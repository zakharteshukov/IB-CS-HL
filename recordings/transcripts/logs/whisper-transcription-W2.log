[00:40.000 --> 00:48.000]  How was your weekend?
[00:48.000 --> 00:54.000]  We can was good. I had workshop in the Japanese time zone.
[00:54.000 --> 01:04.000]  Last two days I was busy with that. Otherwise it was okay.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  How was your weekend?
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  It was good. It was a little bit busy. It's still busy today.
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  Jason, good morning. Nice to meet you.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  Hello, good morning, sir. It's afternoon. Actually, it's three o'clock.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  Good morning, because here is morning. I know.
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.000]  They're also correct.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  Yeah, for me, it's 7.30 p.m.
[01:32.000 --> 01:46.000]  I'm glad to see that you are able to join using the link.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  We have people joining. That's good.
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  Yeah.
[01:56.000 --> 02:16.000]  Do you want to send them a quick reminder?
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  Yeah, I'm going to make an announcement right here on the class.
[02:22.000 --> 02:32.000]  So send one to HL asking them to join through the main class and SL using that guest link.
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  Yeah.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  Okay, by the time we get few more students, it would be great.
[02:46.000 --> 03:00.000]  Jesse and RIOC and Thomas to turn on your camera and let's have some one conversation.
[03:00.000 --> 03:22.000]  Hello.
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  Hello. Hello.
[03:26.000 --> 03:34.000]  Yes, we're here.
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  I'm not able to turn on my camera right now because the cable snapped.
[03:40.000 --> 03:54.000]  But I'll be listening.
[03:54.000 --> 04:08.000]  Okay, we have Maria, Maria joining in.
[04:08.000 --> 04:22.000]  We've had many more students who signed up. Probably they forgot about this meeting.
[04:22.000 --> 04:28.000]  Anyway, it's 7.30 now, so we may expect a few more joining in.
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  Hi, Maria. Welcome. Hello.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  Eugea. Welcome to the class.
[04:36.000 --> 04:50.000]  Guys, since you have joined before others, so it would be good if you can turn your turn on your camera so that any new member coming in, they will know the classroom agreement.
[04:50.000 --> 05:04.000]  With the camera's turned off, it looks as if we are talking to the wall.
[05:04.000 --> 05:08.000]  Thank you.
[05:08.000 --> 05:14.000]  Thank you now. We really appreciate it.
[05:14.000 --> 05:24.000]  Thank you.
[05:24.000 --> 05:30.000]  I can see some of them.
[05:30.000 --> 05:38.000]  Thomas, I can see Thomas.
[05:38.000 --> 05:54.000]  I can see a couple of them, like five. Maria, I can see Maria.
[05:54.000 --> 06:02.000]  Why is it not showing to me?
[06:02.000 --> 06:08.000]  Maybe I could leave and come back. It seems like there's a page of the press issue.
[06:08.000 --> 06:12.000]  I'll just go out of the room and come back in one minute.
[06:12.000 --> 06:18.000]  Okay.
[06:18.000 --> 06:34.000]  You guys were able to join today's webinar using the link on the main class in the classroom online classroom.
[06:34.000 --> 06:48.000]  Okay. Good. I just wanted to check that.
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.000]  So how was the week?
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.000]  Almost. What about the weekend? Did you do something fun or just studying?
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  Something fun. It was good. All right. Well, I'm glad.
[07:06.000 --> 07:17.000]  I watched a bunch of soccer and got with some family friends. I'm friends. So that was good also.
[07:17.000 --> 07:33.000]  All right. I can see.
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.000]  Well, we're getting more people in. That's good. We have 18.
[07:39.000 --> 07:57.000]  33 people absent.
[07:57.000 --> 08:07.000]  Rash, can you see the students now?
[08:07.000 --> 08:15.000]  You're mirrored, Rash.
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.000]  Yes, sorry. Yes, I can see some of them, not all. I think just two of them, but that's okay.
[08:21.000 --> 08:28.000]  I think it's more to do with some internet problem at my end. So we won't waste much time about the internet.
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.000]  So I can see that we have 21 participants in the list. So minus two makes it 19.
[08:33.000 --> 08:44.000]  So we have 19 students and teachers. So Martin and I welcome you to today's class, which is our officially first content oriented class.
[08:44.000 --> 09:05.000]  So as we discussed with you, even during the last webinar, that we are trying to explore new ways in Parmoja to be able to help you deal with the academic content through these weekly classes, which is not a routine practice for other subjects.
[09:05.000 --> 09:14.000]  But we thought that computer science since its very content oriented and it requires a lot of clarifications and explanations.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  So it would be a good idea to meet once in a week for almost an hour. We won't make it more than an hour class.
[09:22.000 --> 09:31.000]  So we'll meet once in a week for an hour and we'll go through the topics that you have covered during that particular week.
[09:31.000 --> 09:45.000]  So like we are in the week two and we instructed you to go through the content from a 1.1.1 to a 1.1.5 from the subject guide, which is already embedded into the learning system in the first week.
[09:45.000 --> 09:51.000]  So that when we meet on Saturday or Sunday, you will at least have some idea about what we are talking about.
[09:51.000 --> 10:04.000]  And if you have any questions, feel free to bring them during these classes so that when you ask for clarifications, it will not just help you, but it will help even other students to understand how things work.
[10:05.000 --> 10:16.000]  We strongly recommend that you should keep this one or reserved every week. I know that sometimes you have certain commitments and you can't help, but you have to deal with other things.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  But only do that in exceptional scenarios.
[10:21.000 --> 10:30.000]  Make it a priority that okay, attending the classes, my priority and rest of the things can fall in place, but in case if there is something which you can't skip, then we totally understand.
[10:30.000 --> 10:40.000]  We will drop us an email saying that you are missing the class and also indicate that in the Google form that we will share every week for the upcoming classes.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  Okay, is that clear to everyone?
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  Yes.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  All right, so Martin, you want to say something before we just start?
[10:51.000 --> 11:00.000]  I'm ready. I'm just a little bit, I guess concern about the kids that were missing today, but they will have access to the court in any way.
[11:00.000 --> 11:20.000]  Yeah, so we so total students we have in SNN HL is 20, 30, 40, about 50, not 50 exactly, but very close to 50, and I see that we have just half less than half the number of actual strength, which is not so good.
[11:20.000 --> 11:30.000]  So when you're watching the recording, those who are not attending life, next week we want to see a higher number, all right.
[11:30.000 --> 11:43.000]  Okay, so just before we begin, we would like to hear from you, how is everything and how was the first week? How is the first week so far?
[11:43.000 --> 11:49.000]  Yes, Sophia.
[11:49.000 --> 12:03.000]  Personally, for me, it was quite good. I've launched through the content, but I accompanied the material on Pamoja with a book that you recommended.
[12:03.000 --> 12:12.000]  And it was really helpful, I would say. It provided additional material that was really beneficial in terms of the understanding.
[12:12.000 --> 12:36.000]  Yes, thank you for sharing that Sophia and I think it will also help other students to kind of understand that getting resources from different sources is actually very helpful in your learning process, because we have worked very hard to to publish and compile material for Pamoja learning platform, but that is just one way of looking at the information that you need to cover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
[12:36.000 --> 12:59.000]  So at least if you have one textbook, which is endorsed by the IB, I think that is going to be very helpful to you, because they are the chapters are organized in the order of subject guide starting from team A going all the way to theme B, and you can easily access the information by just flipping around the pages, and it has some very good explanations.
[12:59.000 --> 13:14.000]  Now, on the Pamoja platform, we had one little, I would say, constraint of using the images, because we don't use the images, which have copyright constraint.
[13:14.000 --> 13:27.000]  So that's really made it difficult for us to find good images, which could support the text material. So you will see a lot of text, but very few images, although we tried our best to create some images, but it's not possible to do everything.
[13:27.000 --> 13:42.000]  So it would be good to have at least one textbook, we are not saying that you should go for had shape application or the Oxford University press, you can make your own decision, both the books are very good and they are endorsed by the IB.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  So any information that you find in those books would be actually very authentic.
[13:46.000 --> 13:55.000]  So if you haven't already procured one in the book, probably you can ask your DP coordinator or the site based coordinator to get one for you.
[13:55.000 --> 14:04.000]  It comes in both the physical copy and also electronic copy, I find electronic copy better because you can easily find information through the searching process.
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  So you just have to press command F and type the topic and it takes you to that particular page.
[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  So it will be helpful and thank you Sophia for bringing that point.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  Anyone else with any other thoughts about first week?
[14:18.000 --> 14:36.000]  Any questions, concerns that you might have? Any, I don't know, maybe any misunderstanding or something you want to clarify in terms of the content?
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  Any risk takers to ask a question?
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  I know, yeah.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  I think the first week was very good as well.
[14:44.000 --> 15:02.000]  It wasn't difficult, I understood what was being said and I think the expansion to a very good and glad to hear that because you know initially when we were posting the content each week.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  We got a feedback from the person who maintains the LMS that it's too much of content.
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.000]  We said, yeah, it is too much, but we cannot help it because that is what students need to learn.
[15:12.000 --> 15:22.000]  But if you're thinking, if you're saying that it was easy to follow and you found the things not so difficult, then we are happy as a feedback that what we have added to the LMS is actually good.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  So thank you for that feedback.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  Thank you, Alexandra.
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.000]  Okay, so I'm sharing the attendance form in the chat.
[15:36.000 --> 15:51.000]  So you can just access this file and yeah, it's a link to the book Microsoft form and you can go to this form.
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.000]  Let me also share my screen so that you can see what where you have to go.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  There's a share screen.
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  Martin, could you confirm if my screen is visible?
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  Yes, I can see it.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  Okay, so this is the form that I have shared with you.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  I can see that the responses are there, so that means it's accessible.
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  So you need to first select the class that you're in.
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000]  And I have resolved that problem that we had last year that it was taking you to the next class.
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  So after you enter your attendance, it will take you directly outside to the end.
[16:40.000 --> 16:50.000]  And so if you choose, let's say my class, pick up your name and then just submit.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  I see that 15 students have done it so far.
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  So we have a few more.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  Let us know if you face any difficulty in accessing the form.
[16:57.000 --> 17:03.000]  We'll do something else.
[17:03.000 --> 17:21.000]  We are still missing attendance from about five students.
[17:21.000 --> 17:29.000]  And just to keep you informed that as a part of our responsibility of the computer science teacher, we need to share these.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  This data with your site based coordinator.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  So if you are attending, you will be marked present.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  And if you're missing, then we have to inform them that you missed it.
[17:38.000 --> 17:44.000]  And if we have a prior information, then we can at least tell them that you already informed us.
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.000]  That you were, you will not be able to attend this class.
[17:50.000 --> 17:51.000]  Okay, so we have 21 entries.
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  I believe we have 26 students.
[17:55.000 --> 18:01.000]  May I know who is not able to mark the attendance yet?
[18:01.000 --> 18:02.000]  Yeah.
[18:02.000 --> 18:05.000]  And we have some more students.
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.000]  Yes.
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  Okay.
[18:08.000 --> 18:09.000]  So I'm not sure.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  Will they be able to see the chat which we posted before they joined?
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  I think they should be able to.
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  Otherwise, I'm facing the link again for those who just joined.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  Probably we'll be able to say it now.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  So these are the names who have already entered.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  So if you see zero against your name, that mean your attendance is not yet recorded.
[18:37.000 --> 18:38.000]  This is the first week of instructions.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  So we are taking a little more time to let you know about the process from next year.
[18:42.000 --> 18:43.000]  It will be faster.
[18:43.000 --> 18:49.000]  So we'll directly jump on to the content as soon as you come.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  Okay.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  So this can continue.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  We'll check it after maybe an hour for all those who have missed it.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  So I'll close this window.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  Okay.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.000]  Now.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  So.
[19:01.000 --> 19:04.000]  We have shared with you a folder.
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  With the links to the recording.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  Okay.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  Let me show you.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  So.
[19:11.000 --> 19:17.000]  That folder is called.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  May 2027.
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.000]  Now I heard from many of you that you have already.
[19:23.000 --> 19:29.000]  You have the access to this folder and you're able to view the recording in case not.
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  Then you should write us an email stating that you are not able to access this.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  Or you have not received the link to this folder.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  If you write to us.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  If you're from HL section B or SL, you can write to Martin.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  And if you're from HL section A, you can write to me.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  And we will make sure that you get the access.
[19:47.000 --> 19:48.000]  Okay.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  So this is right now only one recording of the last week.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  I have also added within this folder another folder, which is content.
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  So I've kind of summarized everything that you have covered in week two.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  In addition to what you already have on the palm of your portal.
[20:04.000 --> 20:10.000]  So this document can be used as a source for you for the revision purpose.
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.000]  So all the topics have bullet points.
[20:12.000 --> 20:19.000]  So it will work as a as a document, which will have the summary of all the topics that we have covered in the first week.
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  So I will also be using this today.
[20:22.000 --> 20:29.000]  While going through the presentation so that you will be aware what this document is all about.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  Can somebody go to that folder and check if you have access to this because.
[20:33.000 --> 20:39.000]  I haven't separately shared this, but I have put this into the recording folder so it should be visible to you.
[20:39.000 --> 20:51.000]  One of you go inside and let me know if you're able to access.
[20:51.000 --> 20:54.000]  Rush is it.
[20:54.000 --> 21:02.000]  So for my end for some reason, I can see it in what channel is it in the.
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  Okay, so Martin only for you like for students, it will be a direct access.
[21:07.000 --> 21:17.000]  Only for you and me, it will have to go through our computer science general tab and then file section.
[21:17.000 --> 21:23.000]  And then within file, it's under the teaching and lessons and lessons.
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  Okay, and within that we have online lesson recordings.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  Okay, I got it. Thank you so much.
[21:30.000 --> 21:40.000]  But for students, it's a direct link so they may have received SharePoint invitation and if they click on that link, they will be able to directly access this.
[21:40.000 --> 21:46.000]  So in case if you have any difficulty, any of the students please write back to us and we'll share this with you.
[21:46.000 --> 21:53.000]  So for any reason, if you miss attending the class, then they will be recording available week after week, so you can just go to.
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.000]  And there are two purposes actually why we are doing it one if you miss the class, you can watch the recording second.
[21:59.000 --> 22:12.000]  These recordings will also be helpful when you are revising these topics like after six months, let's say you want to go back to topic one and you want to just revise what it what all we covered, you can just come back to this folder and watch the recording again.
[22:12.000 --> 22:20.000]  So it will be a good reference resource for you more than any other textbook or any other resources.
[22:20.000 --> 22:30.000]  Can somebody confirm if you're if you have access to this document.
[22:30.000 --> 22:45.000]  Any student I can't see you so you have to unmute your mic and let me know.
[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  Martin is anybody writing anything in the chat if they're able to see.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  Yeah, I got a couple of messages. Let me see.
[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  Okay, I want to access it.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  You're able to access. Okay.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  All right.
[23:03.000 --> 23:10.000]  The other thing that we will share with you are the presentations right now, I haven't put them into that folder.
[23:10.000 --> 23:17.000]  We don't have access to it right now, but we will make this also available for you because if we are preparing some resources.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  We would like you to get benefited out of it. We are not doing it for ourselves, but for you.
[23:22.000 --> 23:30.000]  Okay, so we begin the class. So we are in week two and we are covering the theory topics, computer hardware and operations.
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.000]  And we are primarily covering the topic a 1.1.1 to a 1.1.5.
[23:37.000 --> 23:49.000]  I hope that you all have a copy of the subject guide and if you look into the subject guide, theme a, you will see the list of topics listed under a 1.1.1 to 1.1.5.
[23:49.000 --> 23:57.000]  So I have a student that says that her account is blocked to access.
[23:57.000 --> 24:04.000]  So let me get a note of that and see we can fix it later on.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  So she can access to the record. She said that.
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  So she or she is in the class. Okay, is this.
[24:14.000 --> 24:17.000]  UGA? Yes, UGA.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  Okay, her share point is blocked, right?
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  That's what she said. Yes, there.
[24:24.000 --> 24:29.000]  Fine, no problem. Just make a note of this and we will reshare the folder with social wave.
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  You should don't worry. You will get the you will get the link.
[24:34.000 --> 24:39.000]  Just see that has the same issue.
[24:39.000 --> 24:46.000]  So okay, so somewhat you can just take note of all this and I will just start with the lesson because it's already.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  Yeah, go ahead. I'll try.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  20 minutes.
[24:49.000 --> 24:59.000]  Alright, so during this week, we have covered a couple of topics which are actually related to the internal components of the computer system.
[24:59.000 --> 25:07.000]  So while we are able to see the external parts, like the keyboard, the monitor, the mouse, the trackpad, right.
[25:07.000 --> 25:15.000]  We are able to see that, but we can't see the internal parts until we open the cabinet of the computer or the cover of the laptop.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  So this topic actually deals with all those internal components, which actually makes the computer work.
[25:20.000 --> 25:27.000]  And that includes CPU components and how they interact with each other in order to process the data.
[25:27.000 --> 25:34.000]  We have also covered during week to the role of graphical process and unit that is GPU.
[25:34.000 --> 25:44.000]  Then there is a comparison between CPU and GPU, which is a very important topic and you can definitely expect a question from this during your DP exam, although it is only for HL.
[25:44.000 --> 25:53.000]  So SL students just have to learn about CPU and basic part about GPU, which is covered in a 1.1.2 types of primary memory.
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.000]  So this topic this this week, we have also covered different types of memory in terms of primary memory like RAM, ROM, etc.
[26:01.000 --> 26:13.000]  And then most importantly, we have covered the fetch, decode, execute cycle, which is used by the CPU to get the data to decode the data and then to execute the data to give us the results.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  So this is the topic overview.
[26:16.000 --> 26:36.000]  Now, we all know that the main purpose of the main task of the CPU is to be able to get the inputs from the user and then process that information to give us the output because the whole objective of using computers is to do the work that we want computers to do.
[26:36.000 --> 26:57.000]  And that requires some sort of input and then the processing and finally the output. So there CPU plays a major role as you all may have either read now if you're doing computer science for the first time or you may have even read about this in the in the previous classes if you are studied computer science at any level.
[26:58.000 --> 27:09.000]  So, so when we talk about the CPU's functionality, it coordinates memory input and output devices and it makes logical decisions to control system flow.
[27:09.000 --> 27:20.000]  So the kind of questions which you may expect in the examination is basically explain how the CPU's are significant from the processing point of view.
[27:21.000 --> 27:27.000]  So these are the three key points which you can actually talk about if there's a question about CPU in general.
[27:27.000 --> 27:41.000]  However, if the questions digs deeper into how each component work, then for that you need to have a clear understanding of how basically what are the components of CPU and how each part of the CPU work.
[27:42.000 --> 27:51.000]  So let's go back to this document. Now here, as you can see that CPU is the brain of computer which performs most processing.
[27:51.000 --> 27:59.000]  That's the most fundamental definition for CPU and when you look into the CPU, it comprises of essentially three units.
[27:59.000 --> 28:06.000]  Can somebody unmute the mic? Let me hide this and can somebody tell me what are the three major components of the CPU.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  Come on guys, we need to have interaction going.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  They're for sure in this.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  You have to see you can recall a mathematical unit.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  Yes.
[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  And the register absolutely.
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  So the control unit are a mathematical unit and the register.
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  So these are the three major components of the CPU which actually helps CPU to process data.
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.000]  Now each one of them have their individual roles which you may have studied already that what see what the control unit does.
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.000]  So it directs processor operations and also helps in the fetch decode execute cycle.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  It's very important that you should know this cycle as to what happens during fetch.
[28:55.000 --> 29:03.000]  What happens as during the decode phase and how does CPU execute the instructions and this is a very, very important topic.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  Similarly, the arithmetic logical unit.
[29:05.000 --> 29:16.000]  This is the component which is responsible for making all kinds of arithmetic which is kind of mathematical calculations and also making all kind of logical operations.
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  Can somebody tell me what does what arithmetic we all know like two plus two is arithmetic.
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.000]  What is a logical operation?
[29:25.000 --> 29:30.000]  And or yes, yes.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  Yes, logical operations is correct.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  So logical operations is the process of making a decision based on prior conditions.
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.000]  And that part is also taken care by arithmetic logical unit.
[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  And was it Sophia? Sorry, I cannot see you.
[29:46.000 --> 29:48.000]  Who was it?
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  Yes.
[29:49.000 --> 30:02.000]  Yeah, Sophia. Okay. So Sophia as Sophia said she named certain gates logic gates which is which will be part of next week's studies because logic gates is covered in the next week.
[30:02.000 --> 30:08.000]  But those are the gates which helps which are the part of CPU which makes actually decisions which helps in decision making.
[30:08.000 --> 30:17.000]  And then we have the registers which are used to store information temporarily but they are embedded within the CPU.
[30:17.000 --> 30:24.000]  Right. So essentially when you talk about storage of information we have three different components.
[30:24.000 --> 30:30.000]  Not three different components but there are three different places where the storage happens.
[30:30.000 --> 30:38.000]  One is the secondary storage for example the hardest computer which retains the information permanently until you deliberately delete it.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  So that is for mass storage of data.
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  And at the next level comes the random access memory.
[30:45.000 --> 30:57.000]  So in the random access memory whenever you are running some application the data is temporarily pulled from the secondary storage kept in the primary memory so that the CPU can get the data from primary memory.
[30:57.000 --> 31:01.000]  CPU will never take the data directly from secondary storage.
[31:01.000 --> 31:05.000]  There are some conditions which we will talk about which is virtual memory and all that.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  But in general the CPU never picks the data directly from others.
[31:09.000 --> 31:13.000]  It goes to the RAM and RAM pulls all the data from secondary storage.
[31:13.000 --> 31:18.000]  And there is a reason for doing that. The reason is the CPU is very fast in processing.
[31:18.000 --> 31:23.000]  And if enough data is not supplied to CPU what will happen?
[31:23.000 --> 31:29.000]  Let's say the CPU can execute 10 MB data for second.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  But if it is trying to take the data from secondary storage probably it can just get about 2 MB.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  I'm just taking a hypothetical example.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  So in that case the CPU will remain idle for most of the time.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  It is capable of handling 10 MB but what it is getting is just 2 MB.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  So it will remain idle for long time.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  So that's why the concept of memories of different levels exists.
[31:53.000 --> 31:58.000]  So RAM gets the data so that the CPU can get the data faster.
[31:58.000 --> 32:04.000]  Now in the modern computers like in the old computers the data was coming directly from CPU.
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  But then came the concepts of cache memory.
[32:07.000 --> 32:12.000]  So there was another memory in between the CPU and the RAM to make it even faster.
[32:12.000 --> 32:19.000]  And registers are also temporary storage capacitors which are embedded within the CPU.
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.000]  Where the data finally comes before CPU can take it from for the execution.
[32:24.000 --> 32:29.000]  So those are the different levels. So we have the secondary storage we have the RAM which is primary memory.
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  The next level we have the cache memory and after that we have the registers.
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.000]  This is how the information flows and then goes back.
[32:37.000 --> 32:45.000]  Now if we are talking about the data flow then there needs to be some channel from where the data can flow and that channel is the buses.
[32:45.000 --> 32:53.000]  So within the computer there are different kinds of buses which helps the CPU to transport data from one end to the other.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  And again buses are divided into three parts.
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.000]  The control bus, data bus and address bus and they have their predefined roles.
[33:01.000 --> 33:06.000]  So control bus manages all the signals, read, write, interrupt and all those things.
[33:06.000 --> 33:09.000]  Data bus carries all the data around.
[33:09.000 --> 33:13.000]  Address bus carries the memory address from where the data needs to be pulled.
[33:13.000 --> 33:22.000]  And all buses are actually communication channels within the system which helps the CPU to manage data and also manage the addresses.
[33:22.000 --> 33:32.000]  The CPU earlier like not in the modern computers but in the older times there used to be just one core CPU.
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.000]  But nowadays with the advancement of technology the number of cores in the CPU is increasing.
[33:38.000 --> 33:44.000]  So in the week one we have also covered what single core can do, what multi core or core process can do.
[33:44.000 --> 33:54.000]  So it's important for you to for it is important for you to understand the difference between three different types of core CPU architecture.
[33:54.000 --> 34:04.000]  Can somebody quickly tell me what does single core CPU does?
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  What is the difference between single core and multi core?
[34:07.000 --> 34:14.000]  And so a single core does touch sequentially so it can't do, it can't multi-tacks.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  Just do everything one after the other but in a multi core can do different tasks at this time.
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  Correct. So when we say multi core it doesn't mean that you have multiple CPUs within the computer.
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  It means that the same CPU is split into single core or multiple cores.
[34:30.000 --> 34:37.000]  Now the single core CPU dedicates all its efficiency in solving one problem.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  So the entire CPU power is dedicated to one which has its own benefits.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  I'm not saying that multi core is always better than single core.
[34:44.000 --> 34:47.000]  It depends on the nature of tasks that it is doing.
[34:47.000 --> 34:52.000]  So single core is basically the architecture where the whole CPU power is dedicated to one application.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  Once that is done then the next one and this is how it goes in a sequential way.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  Whereas multi core CPU, the single core, the CPU is split into number of cores.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  And each core is independent of handling one task.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  So that means if you have done 10 applications running, one application can go to core one, second application go to core two.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  So it facilitates multi processing.
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  So multiple applications can actually be carried out using multi core.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  But does it mean single core cannot do multitasking?
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  Yes single core can also do multitasking, but then on the time slicing basis.
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  So what single core will do?
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  Let's say you have 10 applications running.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  It will pick up the first application for a while.
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  Let's say for a fraction of second, then it will leave it and go to the second one process that part and then go to the third one.
[35:40.000 --> 35:50.000]  So it will jump between the applications, but that jumping will be so fast that you as a user will not realize that the applications are not running simultaneously.
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.000]  However, it's not doing one task at a time.
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.000]  It's doing multiple jumps so that it can give some time to all the applications.
[35:58.000 --> 36:03.000]  But because the speed is so fast, we think that it's giving a specific time.
[36:03.000 --> 36:07.000]  It's giving full time to each application, but that's not the case.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  But in multi core, it's different.
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.000]  Each core is actually just handling one application.
[36:13.000 --> 36:21.000]  We'll talk about co process a little later so that you don't get confused between them, which is slightly different architecture than single core and multi core.
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  Okay, so then we have further details about CPU.
[36:25.000 --> 36:33.000]  It's like it's acts like a manager inside the CPU like a supervisor who supervises the whole flow of information and data.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  It's primary role is to direct the flow.
[36:36.000 --> 36:39.000]  It's, I mean, it's a 24 p document.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  So I will just scroll through different sections.
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.000]  And when you're reading through it, you will understand the exact meaning of each of these terms.
[36:48.000 --> 36:59.000]  Now, what is more important here is the fetch decode execution cycle has anyone studied and understood what fetch decode execution cycle is?
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  Boys, we need your participation.
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.000]  Anyone?
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  So I haven't begun that topic yet.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  You haven't begun that topic yet, but we are coming to the end of week one.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  So you should have done it by now.
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  I know.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  It's just that I only got into like a motion.
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  Okay.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  Yeah.
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  No worries.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  So.
[37:35.000 --> 37:48.000]  So going forward, you have to work as a multi core processor because I know you have too many subjects and too many commitments, but then you have to dedicate time for each and every subject equally.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  Especially computer science is a difficult subject.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  I've been telling you we have been telling you since the beginning is a difficult subject.
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.000]  And if you miss even a week next week, because it's all sequential, everything connects to the next topics.
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.000]  Right.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  So if you miss one week, the next week, it will become very difficult for you to understand.
[38:04.000 --> 38:15.000]  So please, I'm not saying that, you know, you are lazy or you have deliberately not done it, but I'm just giving you a reminder that try to be current with what's been covered during each week.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  So as you can.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  Okay. Can somebody else tell me about fixed record execute cycle.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  This is a very important topic.
[38:21.000 --> 38:25.000]  So fetch is to move the data from the storage.
[38:25.000 --> 38:26.000]  Yeah.
[38:26.000 --> 38:31.000]  The coding is interpreting the data.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  Interpreting.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Yes.
[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  And then it's actually taking the action.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  Yeah. Right.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  And then finally, we have the store.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  Thank you for that.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  Please also say your name.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  So that I know who has given that answer because right now I'm on the presentation screen.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  I cannot release your faces.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  I'm not.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  Okay.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.000]  Now, thank you for that input.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  Yeah.
[38:55.000 --> 38:56.000]  So as now.
[38:56.000 --> 38:57.000]  Sorry.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  Hi.
[38:58.000 --> 38:59.000]  Now I just says.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.000]  Thank you.
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.000]  Yeah.
[39:01.000 --> 39:02.000]  Thank you.
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  So.
[39:03.000 --> 39:04.000]  So the fetch.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  Execute cycle is the process which is used by the.
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.000]  By the CPU like for example, we all follow certain cycle.
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.000]  Like if you have to go to the school, you get ready.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  You take a car or you take the school bus.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  You go to the school.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  You get down and then you go to the classroom.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  You study and then you come back home.
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  So that's a cycle.
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  We follow every day.
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  Same way for CPU also to work.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  Professionally, it has to follow a cycle.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  And that cycle is fetch the data.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  And as Nanu said, fetching the data means getting the data from your whichever.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  Input device that you're using.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  Whether it's coming from keyboard or it's coming from the hardest or it's coming from the cloud.
[39:41.000 --> 39:48.000]  So it fetches the data once the data has been fetched that data may not be in the computer readable format.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.000]  So the next step is that that data which has been fetched needs to be decoded to be.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  To convert it into a form which computer can understand.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  And once it has it is converted, then it goes for execution because now the CPU can understand after decoding.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  So it executes and after executing getting the results.
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  It either stores the result or it gives you on the screen or it sends to the cloud.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  So that may differ from one case to another.
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  So that's the cycle which basically a CPU uses.
[40:16.000 --> 40:21.000]  This topic was also there in the previous syllabus and there often used to be questions on fetch.
[40:21.000 --> 40:28.000]  They could execute cycle that draw the draw the fetch execute cycle and write about each stage.
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.000]  And generally that would be about four to five marks.
[40:31.000 --> 40:39.000]  So you should have good understanding about this fetch the code execute cycle.
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  Okay, next is ALU so we already talked about that it performs the mathematical and logical operations.
[40:45.000 --> 40:51.000]  For example, additions attraction multiplication division and all these operations are done using logic gates.
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.000]  So we'll study about logic gates in more details in the I think third week or fourth week.
[40:56.000 --> 41:05.000]  We have a detailed study of that, but as for now you can just know that all the arithmetic operations are done using the logic gates.
[41:05.000 --> 41:16.000]  Logical operations. So that's another thing that CPU does making logical decisions like to make a decision between two different scenarios.
[41:16.000 --> 41:22.000]  Like execute this if the sensor has read the data and the data is beyond the threshold.
[41:22.000 --> 41:28.000]  So there are two parameters read the data and the data is beyond the parameters then take this option.
[41:28.000 --> 41:39.000]  So all kind of logical decisions are made by the CPU as which is the role of logical which is part of logical operations.
[41:39.000 --> 41:46.000]  Now all these results which are calculated by the computer they are kept in a special register which is called a accumulator.
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.000]  You will often hear this term when you will be writing the programs in Java.
[41:51.000 --> 42:00.000]  I will we will often say that store this result in an accumulator so accumulator is a register which flashes itself with the new updated value.
[42:00.000 --> 42:09.000]  So for example if I say X equal to five and let's assume that X is an accumulator and then I say X equal to X plus six.
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  Okay, what it will do it will pick up the previous value of X which was five add six to it and store it back to X.
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  So X is working as an accumulator which is updating its own value after each cycle.
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  And without the ALU the CPU would not be able to process data only move around.
[42:27.000 --> 42:33.000]  Then comes the register now register as we said that it has the primary role is to store some information.
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  Now these are very tiny and size but good enough for to meet the CPU's requirement.
[42:39.000 --> 42:47.000]  Like the purpose of register is not to store mass amount of data but at least the data which is ready for execution.
[42:47.000 --> 42:57.000]  There are different types of registers and they may be asked at the assessment objective one level where you just have to show the factual understanding about what they are.
[42:57.000 --> 43:03.000]  So instruction register is the register which holds the current instruction which is being executed.
[43:03.000 --> 43:13.000]  So if you if you have given a file of let's say size 10 mb not all 10 mb will be executed at once because it will depend on the capacity of the CPU.
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  How many how much of information or how much of data it can execute per cycle.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  So let's say it can it can execute one mb per cycle.
[43:23.000 --> 43:32.000]  So that means 10 mb data will be split into 10 parts and then the first data the first part will go to the IR that is the data which is currently in execution.
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  Once that is done then the second will come then the third until or 10 are done.
[43:37.000 --> 43:43.000]  Now the question is how will CPU know that the entire application is done that is taken care by the program counter.
[43:43.000 --> 43:52.000]  So program counter counts how many parts the data has been split into and then how many are already executed.
[43:52.000 --> 44:00.000]  So as soon as program counter sees that the count is 10 it will tell the CPU that this application is over.
[44:00.000 --> 44:09.000]  So you can see here it automatically increments after each fetch so it will it will know the count beforehand and it will tell the CPU as soon as the count is done.
[44:09.000 --> 44:20.000]  Then comes two important registers memory address register and memory data register can somebody tell me the difference between the two.
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.000]  What's the difference between mayor and mdr.
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  Well memory address register stores the.
[44:28.000 --> 44:34.000]  Well actually the memory address of the data or of these instruction that has to be.
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.000]  Well fetched from the memory whereas the memory data register stores the actual data.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  Very good.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  Yeah that's that's very good answer so see whenever the CPU needs some data.
[44:48.000 --> 44:59.000]  It is the memory address register ma r which will actually go and locate where that data is in the primary memory because primary memory is divided into tracks and sectors.
[44:59.000 --> 45:09.000]  Every track and sector has a specific address so it is the role of ma r to find out where the data which CPU needs is located and once it has found that address.
[45:09.000 --> 45:19.000]  It will instruct the mdr not it will instruct the CU control unit will instruct the mdr that go to ma r address and pull the data from there.
[45:19.000 --> 45:33.000]  So one finds the address and second carries the address so that role is divided between ma r and mdr and finally accumulator as I said that it stores the data temporarily which you also saw before so it's it's the same thing.
[45:33.000 --> 45:49.000]  Now register of crucial because they allow CPU to work at very high speeds without waiting for slower main memory and that's what I told you in the beginning that if the CPU had to depend only on RAM then probably CPU cannot work to the best of its potential.
[45:49.000 --> 46:01.000]  So therefore the these registers actually by the time CPU is processing some data the register will get the next set of instructions so the waiting time for CPU is minimized to the least extent possible.
[46:01.000 --> 46:08.000]  And if CPU has least idle time that would mean that CPU is working more efficiently.
[46:08.000 --> 46:21.000]  Then we have the buses so the definition of buses is given which we talked about control bus controls all the flow of data and information data bus carries the data and address bus carries the address.
[46:21.000 --> 46:34.000]  Now you have to be you have to be clear about this bidirectional and unidirectional the control bus and data bus they are bidirectional but the address bus is unidirectional.
[46:34.000 --> 46:44.000]  If you are using the textbook you may have seen an image which also shows the arrow like both ways or one way.
[46:45.000 --> 46:54.000]  I will try to put an image to this document later so that you will have a clear view of what unidirectional and one bidirectional means.
[46:54.000 --> 47:09.000]  Then come single core multi core so these two we have already discussed one processing unit can handle one instructions stream at a time adequate for basic task but slow at multitasking so it's not that it cannot do multitasking it can do but that will be slower.
[47:09.000 --> 47:19.000]  Multi core means you have the CPU split into many different course and each core is independent of handling one application so the speed automatically improves.
[47:19.000 --> 47:34.000]  However there is a condition that the multi core processor will be able to execute in the multi core mode only when the application is written in a form that that can be split into different course.
[47:34.000 --> 47:44.000]  But if your software is not meant like that then it's a disadvantage because in a multi core only one core will be able to execute your instructions.
[47:44.000 --> 48:01.000]  Like in single core the whole CPU is dedicated to the application in multi core it is split into many parts so if the software is already capable of splitting itself into parts then multi core is better but if not then the speed will rather go slow because only one core is working on your application.
[48:01.000 --> 48:19.000]  So this could be kind of a twisting question that explain to what extent does multi core processor not always beneficial or maybe discuss the scenarios when multi core processor may not be beneficial so that is where you have to give the reasoning.
[48:20.000 --> 48:48.000]  Now comes a co processor so co processor special purpose processor designed to help the CPU with certain types of work for example graphic processor unit for image rendering and audio processes for sound and digital signal processor for telecommunication now how co processes differ co processes is an architecture where you have a matrix you have a matrix of processing unit within the process.
[48:48.000 --> 49:16.000]  Or matrix in the table format and these matrices are very beneficial when the same kind of work is to be replicated by each core when I say matrix they are multiple course but each core is capable of replicating the same set of instruction like for example when you are doing video rendering now the same kind of algorithm is running to render the video.
[49:16.000 --> 49:37.000]  Instead of one core doing the work there are several course which are doing the same formula which are using the same formula to render the video and those are the places where the co processor concept is very popular nowadays we talk more about this because even artificial intelligence is actually possible because of co processors.
[49:37.000 --> 49:50.000]  So co processes unlike multi or single core is different in architecture and is beneficial for those scenarios where the similar kind of task is to be repeated right for example rendering.
[49:51.000 --> 50:05.000]  Now here is the scenario a common misconception is that doubling core automatically doubles the performance which is not true it depends on how will software how well software can use multiple core and other factors like memory speed.
[50:05.000 --> 50:15.000]  So this is something which you may like to explore further that what are the factors that determine the speed of processing of the computer.
[50:16.000 --> 50:32.000]  Then we have put down some practice questions which are in alignment with the I have taken some of these questions from the IP question bank so these questions would be good practice for you to kind of self check as to what you have studied and how much you have understood.
[50:33.000 --> 50:42.000]  So if you even if you solve these problems with full details you may consider your topic revision to be completed even from the exams point of view.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  Before we move to section 1.1.2 any questions from 1.1.1.
[50:47.000 --> 51:13.000]  Anyone has any clarification and now you can see the significance like we have few students who have been answering all the questions because they have only gone through the content and that is the benefit of pre reading before we meet for the classes because you will be then fully ready to get to gain best out of these classes.
[51:14.000 --> 51:24.000]  So this will not be something like teaching it will be more of discussion between what you read and what are the clarifications you would like to have from these topics.
[51:25.000 --> 51:39.000]  Then comes the GPU so as I said graphical user interface graphical processing unit is a specialized processor designed for rapid image video and animation rendering.
[51:40.000 --> 51:56.000]  Now I know that young generation like yours is very fond of playing video games right how many of you have heard of term GPU when you buy a computer generally you are very concerned about GPU right.
[51:57.000 --> 52:09.000]  Jesse says that yes Jesse you know yes GPU yeah Sophia Sophia also a gamer in our class no okay.
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  No actually I like reading rendering now the gaming I like reading.
[52:16.000 --> 52:42.000]  Okay yeah yeah if you're doing 3D rendering then you should be aware of GPU because as I said any kind of work that requires repetition of instructions or in simple words any kind of task which runs the same formula or same algorithms on different segments of the work that is where the GPU the graphical user interface is very very helpful it does the work very fast.
[52:42.000 --> 53:11.000]  Okay so there are some characteristics of GPU as Sophia said that she uses it for 3D rendering so if you are using any of the AI tools for example to convert images into motion or you have recorded a video and you want to use some software for example i movies or any other video rendering software if you have a GPU installed in your computer then you will see the processing speed will be very faster.
[53:12.000 --> 53:41.000]  I used to do a lot of video rendering when I was in my college but that time we had very old seller on processors very slow so after putting the videos on the timeline I remember I used to use the pinnacle studio which was one of the very top much application that time so after putting the videos in the timeline I would put it on rendering and it would take about 48 hours for that video to come.
[53:42.000 --> 54:11.000]  Even if it was 30 minutes video so you will just put it on rendering and then forget about it but now things have changed and I'm not talking about a 50 years ago I'm just talking about 20 years ago when I was in college so that time this there was no concept of GPU the process was very slow the memory was very limited but still people used to do the rendering but that used to take like many hours but now with the GPU it has become much faster because the rendering of 3D videos the video.
[54:12.000 --> 54:26.000]  After processing the machine learning artificial intelligence these have become possible because of the GPU and as I use the term matrix and vector calculations these can easily be done using the GPU.
[54:26.000 --> 54:38.000]  Even the cryptocurrency mining so these are some of the applications of the GPU so for the SL students it is important for you to know what are the key benefits of using GPU.
[54:38.000 --> 54:45.000]  And for HL they need to go little further and they have to learn about how GPUs work.
[54:45.000 --> 54:54.000]  So this is something for self reading and I'm not spending too much time on this these are the characteristics which you need to learn.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  They have small number of powerful cores GPU.
[54:57.000 --> 55:08.000]  Unlike CPU which has usually small number of powerful cores GPU contains thousands of smaller, simpler cores.
[55:08.000 --> 55:23.000]  Now tell me one thing give me a justification of how come the small number of powerful cores is not good for rendering but thousands of smaller, simpler cores is better for rendering.
[55:23.000 --> 55:28.000]  Oh sir better at multitasking.
[55:28.000 --> 55:41.000]  It's multitasking but there's a condition multitasking plus it is a similar kind of work or similar algorithm which is running on each core that makes it super fast.
[55:41.000 --> 55:49.000]  So when you're doing the video rendering the video rendering task is working on one single algorithm one single formula.
[55:49.000 --> 55:56.000]  Now that formula is replicated on each tiny core so they are able to do the same work at a much faster speed.
[55:56.000 --> 56:09.000]  Right and that is why it is used in machine learning in the in the cryptocurrency mining in the video rendering in the in the 3D animations GPUs are very very powerful.
[56:09.000 --> 56:20.000]  To make GPUs excellent for processing larger data sets especially when the same calculation see the same calculation needs to be repeated across many pixels images or data sets.
[56:20.000 --> 56:31.000]  So any such scenario where the same calculation needs to be run for many different parts of the application GPUs are important.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  So this goes further details about how GPUs work.
[56:35.000 --> 56:46.000]  GPUs in artificial intelligence this is for HL and you need to know how the GPUs actually help in the machine learning and artificial intelligence.
[56:46.000 --> 56:57.000]  They are used in cryptocurrency so please give it a reading properly to know and understand what is GPU how it works and what are the applications of GPU.
[56:57.000 --> 57:04.000]  And then we have the questions related to GPU so after you have read about it please go through these questions and try to answer them.
[57:04.000 --> 57:12.000]  It will be good if you can make your personal notes finding the answers of these questions and keeping it for your personal reference.
[57:12.000 --> 57:25.000]  And honestly again I'm repeating even if you do complete this much of questions from this a point a 1.1.2 I don't think you will ever get any question beyond this this is more than enough.
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.000]  Then comes a 1.1.3 which is about differences between the CPU and GPU.
[57:34.000 --> 57:43.000]  Now if you have studied about CPU and GPU it properly in a 1.1.2 then this is just a further extension to that.
[57:43.000 --> 57:52.000]  This is going little more into technical side as to in terms of architecture how CPU and GPU are different from each other.
[57:52.000 --> 58:00.000]  So we already studied about CPU have few cores but they are very powerful core but GPU has 1000 soft model cores.
[58:00.000 --> 58:12.000]  Now think about a general application let's say you want to play you want to run a software for example financial software.
[58:12.000 --> 58:18.000]  Which of the two applications do you think will be better CPU or GPU.
[58:19.000 --> 58:27.000]  You are trying to run a financial application let's say which of the two would you prefer CPU or GPU.
[58:27.000 --> 58:31.000]  I think it's CPU.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  Yeah it's CPU.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  Mark acceleration.
[58:34.000 --> 58:40.000]  Yeah CPU because because the calculations will be varying from one another.
[58:40.000 --> 58:47.000]  So in that case it's not a replication of same calculation because the calculations would differ from one aspect to another.
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  So it's not the same kind of work which is happening.
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  Okay however let's say we want to you have create you have a collection of images.
[58:55.000 --> 59:03.000]  And now you want to put them together using a video animation software to convert it into a moving object which one will be used.
[59:03.000 --> 59:07.000]  GPU.
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.000]  Did you say GPU.
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  Did you say GPU or CPU.
[59:16.000 --> 59:22.000]  We have we have couple of images which are still images and we want to give them motion using some AI tool.
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  Which process of do you think will be better CPU or GPU.
[59:27.000 --> 59:30.000]  GPU GPU.
[59:30.000 --> 59:36.000]  Exactly and it is for a simple reason that while converting the images into video.
[59:36.000 --> 59:43.000]  The same calculation needs to be carried for each image in fact for each frame of the image.
[59:43.000 --> 59:48.000]  And that is where the role of GPU will come into picture that each calculation will go into one.
[59:48.000 --> 59:52.000]  One sector of the matrix and that will be processed simultaneously.
[59:52.000 --> 59:58.000]  So it will be much faster right.
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000]  In terms of design philosophy CPU general purpose processor designed to handle a wide range of task.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  So when you have different kind of task then CPU is much stronger than GPU.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  It executes operating system instructions user commands and most applications logic prioritize flexibility and decision making.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  So for general purpose CPU is used but GPU specialized processor which actually works on where the calculations are extremely.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Sorry built to perform specific types of calculations extremely efficiently focused on parallel processing.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Now this is the term parallel processing of large amount of data such as graphics rendering ideal for task with the same operation must be performed many times simultaneously.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  So the major difference between CPU and GPU is that CPU is for different kinds of applications.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  Whereas GPU is for same kind of task which needs to be completed faster.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:04.000]  Then comes the core architecture like you may have heard CPU is one core double core it's a four core CPU is a 16 core CPU.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  So when you go and buy a new computer you will see on the specification that how many cores this CPU has more is the course higher will be the price.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  Because CPU architecture is will be more advanced if there are more number of course but my question is let's say you buy a 16 core CPU and you buy a 3032 core CPU which will be faster.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  If you have two options you go to buy a laptop the seller says that okay this is a 16 core CPU and this is a 32 core CPU which one do you think will be faster.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  The 32 core sheets your course.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Okay so I'm sure that majority of you will think 32 core which is correct but there are conditions that number of course alone does not decide the speed of the computer.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  There are many other things for example how much is the memory in the 32 core computer let's say you have 16 GB RAM.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Whereas in the 8 core CPU you have 64 GB RAM right so probably the 16 core CPU will work faster than 32 core CPU.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  So there is a there is a threshold limit that you have many cores but can your RAM store that much of data to supply to 32 cores.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  If yes then your system will be fast but you have 32 cores but the data which is coming is just enough for 10 cores then remaining 22 cores will always remain idle.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  So in that case the efficiency of CPU will decrease.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  So if you ever see a question that what are the factors that influence the speed of a CPU then you should say the factors include the core architecture for example how many cores.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Then it also depends largely on the on the primary storage and it will also depend on the bus bus speed.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  So how much data can bus transmit during the fetch decode executes cycle so everything needs to be synchronized for the CPU to work perfectly.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  If anything is too high and something is too low then your CPU will not give the optimum solution optimum speed.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Then GPU core thousands of smaller simple cores each core is not as powerful as CPU but together they perform massive parallel computations.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  This parallel is the keyword so you have to be mindful about that so whenever you talk about GPU say thousands of CPU core which are working parallel for parallel computation.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  And then the example they are good for image rendering and all that memory access so these are different see what we are studying right now is about the difference between CPU and GPU in terms of design in terms of number of course and in terms of memory access so you need to know all three parts and even power efficiency.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Definitely CPU will consume less power because there are less cores whereas GPU has so many different cores and every core requires some electrical pulses so the electrical power needed for GPU will be much higher than the CPU and that is why you may have heard that for the AI servers to work they consume a lot of power.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Like if you use let's say chat GPT or per perplexity to even generate a small image the amount of electricity that CPU will take or the computer will take would be as good as let's say one unit of electricity it consumes a lot of power because there are so many tiny processes which are working and they need power.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  Practical application for CPU and GPU we have talked about this so let's move to the next one how okay there's another model which is hybrid don't think that if one computer is based on a CPU architecture and one is based on GPU architecture they can be two different architectures in two different laptops that's possible.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  But then to get the optimum user of your laptop the new machines actually come with a combination of both which is called a hybrid model so your CPU will be single double or or four course or six course and then also you will have the GPU installed into that so depending on the nature of task if you are doing the video rendering that will go to the GPU if you are doing normal processing that will go to the CPU so they will know which application is to be run by them and accordingly they will be able to do it.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  Make a decision and that will make your system more and more efficient imagine a system which is just which just carries a GPU it will not be very efficient for different kinds of task it will rather go slow and if you are using CPU and if you are doing video rendering again it will be slow but if you have use a hybrid model then together they will be able to decide which CPU or GPU will take up the task and it will become much faster.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000]  So the new computers have the flexibility of having both working simultaneously.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:36.000]  Then we have the practice questions from this topic then we have the purposes of different memory types now this is something which you have been studying from your childhood time I'm sure.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  What is the difference between RAM and ROM so essentially there are four types of memory RAM ROM cache memory and registers we already talked about the registers they are only they are embedded into the CPU what is the what is the RAM and ROM.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  Those who have studied computer science in grade eight nine ten they should know what is RAM and ROM.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  Well, the random access and memory holds all the data and instructions for the programs that are currently in use currently running let's say a various redone memory well as far as I remember it's basically for it's used with bios of the computer like it stores.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  The instructions for the initialization of the computer and also it transfers the software data the software application data to the computer well as far as I remember yeah.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  Like if you want to set up the windows you will have fresh first go to the bias and upload from the secondary memory the software to the computers.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  I can only give you a round of applause guys this is and this is an excellent answer and she has covered more than actually what I expected so.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  As you can see that the RAM and ROM both are used for storing information and as the software rightly said RAM is the memory which actually holds the data which is currently being executed by the CPU now imagine a scenario that you want to let's say play a game.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  Now the game is stored on your hard disk or it is in the cloud now when you access that game that game goes to the RAM and from RAM it goes to the CPU so RAM is a temporary memory which stores the data temporarily while the CPU is executing it it is a volatile memory volatile means it will lose the data if you turn off the computer because it's a temporary memory.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  It will also flush itself out when the application execution is finished so that the other applications can come and get some space in the RAM however ROM is basically a permanent storage which contains most of the system files which are needed for the smooth functioning of the computer.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  So as a software user word bios basic input output system those softwares are stored in the ROM and they are very helpful in the booting process so when you start your computer the operating system roll comes little later but before that the start of files are stored in the RAM read only memory.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  Okay it is embedded into that and we cannot delete it whether computer is turned off or like how we delete files in the hard disk we cannot delete the data in the ROM under the normal circumstances and if your data gets corrupt in the ROM then there is no way that your system can start because ROM contains the special system files which checks everything related to the system that is RAM working fine is input and output devices connected to your computer it will check the power.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  Input and output to different components so all the initial checkups are carried by the ROM and these are free pre-feated instructions which are inserted into the ROM by the manufacturer.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  So if you are buying an Apple computer the ROM chip will have the instructions feed by the Apple computer if you are buying let's say Samsung or Acer they will make the ROM filled with the instructions which are needed for the running of the operating system.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  It also contains lot of other things like for example when you switch on your mobile phone you see the logo in the beginning now that logo etc everything is stored in the ROM and it is unchangeable you cannot change them what is embedded into that that stays there forever.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  So that's about ROM permanent instruction non-volatile and we can't even delete it I mean you need special software to delete the content of the ROM and why will we do that because why do you want to fiddle with system files which may impact the functionality of your computer.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  Then comes the cache memory which sits in between the RAM and CPU and cache memory is also I mean you have two options either it can be embedded within the CPU or you can have a separate chip also for cache.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  Depending on what computer you have procured now the benefit of cache is that it is a super fast memory it is much faster than RAM and ROM and it is very close to the CPU.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  So from hard disk or cloud the data goes to RAM from RAM it goes to the cache memory and from cache memory it goes to the registers and from registers it goes to the CPU.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  And because the cache memory is made up of material which is very fast in nature so the CPU's ideal time is reduced if the data comes to the cache memory.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Cache is a new concept the old computers did not have it like if you talk about if you look at the computers which were manufactured in 1995 to year 2000 that was the time when the cache memory started to emerge but before that the computers didn't even have them.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  So each type has a distinct purpose contributing to efficient CPU operation so every new innovation is actually possible because of these changing trends in the technology.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  When we'll study about the hard disk or the secondary storage device you will see how we have progressed from magnetic disks to now the most recent SSDs and how the speed has become better and better with the new technologies.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  But that is not the part of this topic so we'll study that later.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Then it's further details about RAM volatility impact on performance more RAM allows more programs to run simultaneously without slowing down.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  So if your computer is getting stuck if you run few applications that means your RAM is not able to take all those applications and if you increase the RAM of your computer probably it will become slightly better in terms of speed.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  But then your CPU should also be able to handle that much of data.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  In smartphone switching between apps is quick because apps remain in RAM until close or replace that you know that RAM keeps the data until either you turn off your phone or the processing of an application is completed.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  So let's say you have an application which is currently being executed by the CPU that stays in the RAM as soon as the CPU gets the instruction from program counter that the application is done.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  The operating system will pull that information out of the RAM so that the space is created for next application.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  So all that switching is actually done by the by the operating system.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Then we have the ROM BIOS basic input output system or a form where which runs self tests and loads the operating system when the device is powered on.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  ROM is non-volatile so it retains the data even when the power is turned off modern variation many computers now use flash memory a form of ROM that can be updated for example BIOS updates.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  This is a new enhancement in the ROM where even though it is non-volatile it cannot be deleted but then there are ways that the system itself will download the latest updates and it will update the BIOS.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  It may not be possible for us to do it manually but the architecture of the system could go into the BIOS and updated and that is called the BIOS updates.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  You may also have seen on your mobile phone sometimes you get the updates and it says that it will update your BIOS whether you agree or not and if you say yes it will go and update it.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  On a phone ROM stores the operating system so it is always available during the startup.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  Now the cache memory it acts as a middle player as I said between RAM and CPU from the
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  instructions data so that CPU can avoid fetching them repeatedly from RAM so instead of going all the way from CPU to RAM now there is an intermediate cache memory which is much faster in data transmission and it is much closer to the CPU.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  So the data goes from RAM to cache memory and from cache memory to the CPU for the faster execution and there are different levels depending on the size how much data it can hold L1, L2, L3 and most recent L4.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  No L3. L3 is the latest one which can store up to 2 MB to 6 to 64 MB.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Okay then another thing the number doesn't mean that it is fastest as you can see here L1 cache which is smallest but it is fastest.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  Look it directly on the CPU code often split into instructions L1i and data L1d cache.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  L2 this is the capacity slightly slower and L3 and this could be one of the tasks that you may do that how come a small 32 kb is faster than a large 64 MB cache.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  You can take this for further research to find out the reasons why it is so.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  Okay cache hit a cache hit is basically a process where CPU may be working at a certain speed and if CPU wants to fix some data and it finds the data as soon as it contacts the cache memory that is called a faster way of accessing which is the cache hit if the cache hit is higher that means the CPU is working faster.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  And cache hit means CPU is ready to process the data but when it goes to the cache it doesn't find any data so that means the cache the CPU has to wait for some more time.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  After waiting for some more time it goes again and it finds the data so but there was some delay time there was some delay so that will slow down the machine.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  So you may remember this cache hit and cache mess in terms of the efficiency of the CPU.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  Cache notes on your desk RAM books in your room and hard drive library across town who do you tell me about this analogy what it means.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  I want one of the boys to speak what is this analogy hello hello hello yes sir go ahead.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  The way I would think about this the fact that since the cache is so easy to locate at but only contains a small amount of information it kind of works as sticky notes and that.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  As RAM which is a little slower to access but it still like not at all as much information as you can locate in your hard drive would be like a bookshelf in the room like very close by but.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  Small amount of information compared to the hard drive which is a gargantuan amount of information or far away.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  Thank you for that contribution and I completely agree this is a scenario as I said that first come hardest then comes RAM and then comes the cache and if CPU has to pull the data obviously cache is the closest one so it can pull it faster.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  Now think about a library kind of scenario you you are in the school and you have the library you have the library little far from your classroom which has the book that is first scenario.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  Now again the book is kept somewhere in your room and third scenario the book is right in front of you on the table and you want to access the book obviously the book which is on your table would be accessible at the most fastest way right that is what is cache memory.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  The cache memory is very close to the CPU so the CPU can easily fetch the data the next level is RAM so the book is in your room so you have to get up go and get the book which will be little time consuming.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  And the third which is hard disk is the library far from your room so you have to go all the way to the library to pull the book so that defines the speed at which you can access the book.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  And then we have different types of registers for example the program counter we talked about that we have the instruction register which stores the next instruction which is to be executed.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  Program counter counts how many are done MDR we have done AC we have done registers allow the CPU to execute instructions are maximum speed by avoiding delays from the RAM size very small in capacity measured in bytes or words but critical for efficiency.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  A CPU can work even without registers but then the whole dependency will be on the RAM so it has to go all the way to the ramp for every fetching that will slow down the speed.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  And then we have these practice questions so you may take them up in your free time and try to solve them.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  Last topic for today is the fetch decode execute cycle and who shared with us fetch decode was it nano.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:21:04.000]  Was it nano who talked about fetch decode yes yes okay right so nano your favorite topic we are getting on to fetch decode executed CPU gets the instruction from the memory decode it interprets the instructions and executes CPU performs the required action and fourth stage which is generally not talked about but that is storage but you don't have to study that because that's not in your course.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  So essentially you have to think about these three stages fetch decode and execute the registers which are involved in this whole process is program counter MDR instruction register and accumulator so you should know what they are and what do they work like Sophia mentioned about MDR and MDR that one looks for the address and MDR goes there to pull the pull the data and then we have the buses which actually actually carries the data.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  This cycle repeats continuously as long as the computer is running.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  This is also sometimes called instruction cycle so don't get confused if you see the word instruction cycle it's same as fetch decode execute.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Okay now this is the algorithm which is followed and when we will do the programming I will ask you to write this cycle in the form of a Java program.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  So please get yourself familiar with how the fetch decode execute cycle works.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  So program counter what it does MDR what it does reading signal memory data register instruction cycle and program counter these are six or seven stages which you should be familiar with and I can guarantee you that in your DP exam you will have minimum four to five mark question based on this these stages so this very important.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:41.000]  Then above decode what happens in the decode so CPU the control unit interprets the instruction if it is an algorithm arithmetic operation it signals the ALU.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  If it requires data from memory it sets up the MDR and MDR if the control operation like branching it adjust the program counter so that is what happens in the decode stage essentially it's identifying the nature of the task and activating the related component of the computer.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  The decoding process ensures that CPU understands what is what the instruction means before execution so it also converts the data into machine readable format so two things are happening here.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  One is CU interprets the instruction and second the decoding of the instruction is happening then comes the execution cycle and there are roles of CU ALU and accumulator which you should be aware of.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:51.000]  This is a very important topic I am repeatedly telling you and this is an example given which is from the assembly language as to how the instruction of data needed this is just additional thing I mean for your understanding you can read this but this will not be asked as to how the fetch decode execution works what is important is this part this whole thing fetch decode and execute.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  Importance of cycle why is this cycle important so that's about fetching the instructions and then executing them so similar to this document we will be creating the documents for each week that you are covering and this will be in addition to what you already have on the palm of your.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:43.000]  But both Martin and I would like to strongly recommend that if you want to get best benefit out of these classes then please come prepared take some inspiration from Sophia she is very well prepared for she was very well prepared for today's lesson and you saw the responses the quality of responses and few others like nano and few others so part actively in the classroom.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  So we don't really want to make it a teacher oriented lecture but we want to make it more like a discussion with each other because honestly see computer science is not an easy subject I'm telling you again and again it's a very difficult subject but if you are developing a good understanding week after week then probably you will be able to manage it quite easily.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  All right, so I will give you five minutes time to ask any questions if you have or any other difficulties about the LMS issues or accessing the video any any other issues that you want to discuss.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  We can find this document.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  Okay, thanks.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  Okay, who would like to answer this question, where can he find this document, who remembers.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  Who remembers where this document can be found from.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Okay, Luis, where can you find this document? Louis.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  It wasn't about document but when you were mentioning about ROM I found it interesting that I need a connection because something that I remembered.
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  Because there is a Linux based operating system that it called sales OS that is known for giving it total anonymity when or at least it gives it any of how you use it and it runs purely on RAM so one of the objectives based on this operating system is generally any trace in your system and trace of quality.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  So it makes totally sense now that you connect with the rent and how it's based on temporary so.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  Absolutely interesting.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  Yeah, true and every operating system has its own own way of handling the RAM like how it works on Ubuntu, which is on Linux, which is a Unix based system would differ from how it works in a Windows based system.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  So every operating system has its own architecture as to how it does the time slicing.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  I don't want to go into the depth of those techniques otherwise we'll confuse some students but then every operating system is capable of handling the RAM in different ways.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  The whole objective is to make the efficient use of RAM so that the maximum applications can run simultaneously.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  All right, so nobody knows where to find our document.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  Let me show again.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  It isn't the files you've shared on by your point if you can look there it's in the direction exactly so.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  If you if you go to the document which is shared with you on the share point where you find the recording in the same folder you will find this PDF also.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Oh, I don't know where to find the recording.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  You can find the recording.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000]  Okay, so you're in excel section right.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  I mean, HR.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  You're in excel.
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  Okay, just drop us an email.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  We will reshare the folder with you.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  So where can I find the folder?
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  You if you actually be sent an email to you, you may have received an email from share point inviting you to reset your password.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]  Okay, if you haven't, if you haven't, have you got that?
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  Yes.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  So there's a link that access the folder.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  So when you click on that, it will send you a OTP one time password and then you have to enter that to access the documents.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  I will share this presentation also with you, which is a shorter form of the larger document that you just saw.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  So it's just a summary of points.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000]  But since we have only created it, so I don't mind sharing it with you.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  So this will be good for revision purpose.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  Okay.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  Before we pray, do you want to do a coward quiz?
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  Are you find going in for a coward?
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  Yes, Martin, my question. Sorry, Martin.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  No, I'm sorry, is that.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  Gea is saying that she cannot talk that she has some questions and it looks like several students still have a lot of issues connecting.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  Jacida has a lot of issues.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000]  She has sent a couple of emails.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  What I can say is that I will take a look into what the issues are and we'll try to answer your questions through the way.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  Yeah, sure.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  One second.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:40.000]  Yeah, and some people don't can access the folders still.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  Ueis from the SL section and they cannot access the folders with the documents.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000]  Okay, okay.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.000]  So I will share the will create a folder and share the links with them.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000]  I think I created a quiz for this chapter.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000]  Let me see if I can find that.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  While you find it, I have created a slide for a PowerPoint kind of to help them understand the fish, the code and execute.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  I don't know you to go over that.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  But if not, then we can do that.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000]  Maybe we can we can do in the next next lesson.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  Maybe we'll start with fetch to code execute cycle and then we'll move to the next.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  But we can share that we can put that document a presentation in the folder and.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  Okay.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  Okay, guys, let's do.
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000]  Is there a question somebody asking question?
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000]  Yeah, I didn't get an email from this share point.
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000]  Okay, so just drop us an email, drop an email, we'll make it for you.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  Okay, could you join this game?
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:20.000]  What is 64 007?
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  Those who don't know which link to go do I put it in the chat?
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:53.000]  I can see only 15 have joined can others also join.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:32:04.000]  19 20.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  Okay, so I'm starting the game, respecting everybody's time.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000]  So we start.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  There are 15 questions, but maybe let's see how it goes.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000]  I will stop it either at 10 or otherwise we will.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  Okay, so I can see a mixed kind of response.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  Some of you said instruction registers.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000]  Program counter is the one that actually holds the address of the next instruction.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  So that's the correct answer program counter.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000]  So if you read the definition of program counter, it holds the address of the next register, which is to be executed.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000]  I are keeps the at the instruction, which is currently being executed.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000]  That's the difference.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:09.000]  So it's a tricky question, but PC is the correct answer.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:16.000]  So we have Ricardo on the top, Louis and Namo.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  This should be all correct.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  Okay, so one of you felt a control unit.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000]  Now it's arithmetic, but 15 have given correct answer and some of them.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  I think did not answer anything.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  So majority set see ALU, which is good.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  Ricardo, Namo and Louis.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  Main function of the control unit.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  Okay, so 13 of you felt that it's direct data flow, which is good.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  If you said perform logical operations, no, that is the work of a component of CPU, which is algorithmic and logical unit.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  But control unit directs the flow of data and instructions.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  Louis is heading up Namo is third and Ricardo still maintaining the top position.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  Okay, so majority of you said control bus, which is the correct answer.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  So it's not data bus because data bus actually carries the data address bus carries the address.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  But what is to be done is controlled by the control bus.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  Louis gone down Alexa has come up Namo still on number three.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  Instruction register. Yeah, that's the correct answer.
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  There was a confusion between a accumulator.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  Accumulator does not hold the instruction, but it holds the temporary results after the calculation.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  MDR holds the address program counter holds the address of next instruction.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  And IR is the one that holds the fetched instruction, which is to be executed.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  Okay, Ricardo number three and Namo is on the top followed by a new name Ben on the second position.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  Sequential task.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000]  I knew that some of you will say GPU, but it says for the sequential task.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  So which is a single core CPU because the whole efficiency of the CPU is dedicated to the application.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  So single core CPU is the right answer. Alexa going up Louis Ricardo coming back to the frame.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  Panel task.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  14, yeah, so majority of you said for a GPU. Some of you felt co processor.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  No, co processor concept if you recall that is something different.
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:54.000]  So GPU is the one which is specialized in parallel tasks.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  So that means you have to go back and read about what co processor does.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  Unchanged Namo on the top now.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  Why is GPU faster for AI training?
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  Perfect, so majority of you said many parallel course, which is good.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  Unchanged.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000]  This would be all correct.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Okay, so two of you felt it's ram. No, ram is not non volatile.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  Ram is volatile memory.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  Then two of you said cash. No, we are saying firmware firmware is the special system software, which is stored.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  Performantly so it's it's wrong read only memory.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  Okay, Ben gone down Alexa going up and Louis on the third position.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  Fastest birth smallest.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  Okay, so I anticipated that many of you will say cash memory, but no registers is the smallest memory, but the fastest because it is embedded within the CPU.
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  So registers is the fastest and smallest cash is not smallest.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.000]  Okay, course remains unchanged. I'm sorry, the ranking remains unchanged.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  What is the cash hit?
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  Data found in the cash that is the cash hit and cash misses when data is not found in the cash.
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:26.000]  Okay, we have Jay seal coming up software in the frame after long, long time and number on the top.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  All right, so many of you felt it's decode. No, after the decoding is a bit step of cycle places the instruction into the instruction register.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:52.000]  So it's the fetch, fetch cycle after which the data goes into higher and then it is decoded and then sent to the memory to the CPU.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  Cash SL going up on number three, we have three more questions.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  What does the CU do?
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  All right, so majority of you know it interprets the instructions that the correct answer.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  You felt runs the program and one of you said fetches data.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  One said source result. No, the role of CU is to interpret instructions.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  Okay, so no changes in the rank.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Which stage of the cycle automatic actually runs the instruction.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  So majority of you said execute, which is correct. One of you said decode. No, the decode does not run the instruction decode it decodes it and then gives it to the CPU, but execution is the site stage when the program is run.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:15.000]  I think last question. Yes, all the best.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  Until the CPU is turned off that fetch decode execution cycle keeps on repeating.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  So let's see the podium. We have on number three.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  Alexa, good work, Alexa.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  We have just still on number two and we have on the top position.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  Well done guys, this is lovely.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  And then we have Ricardo and Sophia who was leading for a very long time Ricardo, but well done everybody.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  It's really nice. Nice to have seen your performance in the quiz.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  Okay, so with that we come to the end of today's lesson.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  The recording will be made available in the folder most likely by tomorrow.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:18.000]  So tomorrow evening, if you go to the folder, you should be able to see the recording.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  Any questions before we leave.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  For the share point, you just drop us an email and we will reshare the link.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  Even if you have any other queries, the best way to reach out to us is by writing to us.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  Otherwise, when we meet during the weekly meetings, that is also the time when you can actually discuss your problems.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  So I can see that some of you are saying that you had difficulty in clicking the answers.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  That's okay. It was just a game.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  If nothing else, Martin, do you want to add something or we just.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  Now we're good. I think we have a good class today.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  I hope you enjoyed guys and let's get the best benefit of these classes because we are making an extra effort.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  To have these classes conducted. This is not really something that is expected from us.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000]  Because Parmoja works in a slightly different manner.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  It's not really expected from us, but we want to see you as successful candidates for the for this ID computer science course.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  So we are willing to go an extra mile, but you also have to take an initiative and get best out of it.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  Malaria, you have a question or.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  Thank you.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. We appreciate your time.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  Good luck and have a good day. Bye. Bye everyone.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  Bye guys. Have a great rest of the day. Bye.
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  Thank you.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000]  Sure. Bye everyone.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  Thank you so much. Bye.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000]  You're welcome. Have a good day.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  All right. Okay.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  Thank you. Bye bye.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  Martin, you want to come on.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000]  Martin, you want to come on teams?
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  I will just create a meeting.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  Yeah, go ahead and do that.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  Okay. I'm going to leave here.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000]  Yeah, sure.
