[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  You
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  You
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  You
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.000]  You
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  You
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  You
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  You
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  You
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  You
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  You
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  You
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  You
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  You
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  You
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  You
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  You
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  You
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  You
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  You
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  You
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  You
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  You
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  You
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  You
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  You
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  You
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.560]  Is there a way here to like chat?
[10:01.560 --> 10:03.040]  Oh yeah, chat, I think.
[10:03.040 --> 10:03.880]  Yeah.
[10:03.880 --> 10:05.640]  I'm using it for the first time,
[10:05.640 --> 10:08.080]  but I can see that it has, essentially,
[10:08.080 --> 10:10.080]  it has everything that we see in Zoom.
[10:10.080 --> 10:14.240]  It looks like a nice video conference in total.
[10:17.920 --> 10:19.120]  Yeah, I can see that.
[10:21.360 --> 10:23.200]  So I can see students are still joining in.
[10:23.200 --> 10:25.400]  We have total 11 participants.
[10:25.720 --> 10:26.680]  Including two of us.
[10:26.680 --> 10:28.680]  So that means nine students.
[10:30.400 --> 10:31.080]  Did you,
[10:32.720 --> 10:35.800]  did you take a look at the slideshow?
[10:35.800 --> 10:38.440]  I added the information from the directory.
[10:38.440 --> 10:39.360]  That's what I did.
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.680]  Yeah, later I shared with you another pile.
[10:42.680 --> 10:45.000]  So we are going to use that.
[10:45.000 --> 10:45.840]  Okay.
[10:45.840 --> 10:50.840]  Did you get any shared document from Microsoft Teams?
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  No, no from Microsoft Teams.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.800]  I just, I just modified the file
[10:58.800 --> 11:00.840]  that you share with me through Google.
[11:01.840 --> 11:04.680]  But I didn't put anything in there.
[11:04.680 --> 11:07.280]  Okay, so no, I made some changes.
[11:07.280 --> 11:11.080]  And I put that in the, in our presentations folder
[11:11.080 --> 11:14.000]  in the, in the Microsoft Teams SharePoint.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.160]  Okay, let's me.
[11:15.160 --> 11:17.680]  So it's okay, you can have a look at that later.
[11:18.640 --> 11:19.640]  Okay.
[11:20.640 --> 11:25.080]  So we have one more student who has just joined.
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.280]  Hi, hello, everyone.
[11:28.280 --> 11:30.520]  It's good evening from my side and Martin.
[11:31.400 --> 11:32.400]  Good morning, everybody.
[11:32.400 --> 11:34.240]  He's morning from, from my end.
[11:35.560 --> 11:38.960]  Okay, so it would be great if we can turn on the camera
[11:39.840 --> 11:42.360]  because it will be good for us
[11:42.360 --> 11:44.520]  because the whole purpose of today's meeting
[11:44.520 --> 11:45.680]  is to know each other.
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.360]  So even though it's also in a smooth of learning,
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.440]  but at times we'll be meeting with each other
[11:53.440 --> 11:56.400]  and it would be great if you can turn on the camera
[11:56.400 --> 11:59.040]  just like the way our teacher walking into a classroom
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.240]  and they can see everyone.
[12:00.240 --> 12:04.960]  So can I request everyone to please turn on the camera?
[12:04.960 --> 12:06.720]  Yeah, that looks much better.
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.680]  Thank you.
[12:12.560 --> 12:15.040]  Thank you, Sophia, for being a risk taker
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.160]  to be the first one to come and follow by Thomas.
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.600]  And we have a warning in Valencia.
[12:26.640 --> 12:27.760]  Sorry, Valeria.
[12:27.760 --> 12:28.600]  I'm sorry.
[12:28.600 --> 12:30.240]  Good morning.
[12:30.240 --> 12:31.080]  Bradley.
[12:31.080 --> 12:32.080]  Good morning.
[12:32.760 --> 12:34.480]  Thomas.
[12:34.480 --> 12:35.640]  Marco.
[12:35.640 --> 12:36.640]  Lucas.
[12:36.640 --> 12:37.640]  Ricardo.
[12:37.640 --> 12:45.120]  Yeah, I can see a different intensity of light
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.080]  in the background, which means for some people
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.040]  it's daytime and for others, it's night.
[12:51.040 --> 12:53.200]  Bradley, what's time there in your place?
[12:59.080 --> 13:01.040]  When you leave yourself.
[13:01.040 --> 13:02.040]  Yeah.
[13:02.040 --> 13:09.040]  Oh, Bradley, what's the time in your region?
[13:09.040 --> 13:13.040]  Night time, it's very late.
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.040]  What's the time?
[13:20.040 --> 13:23.240]  Are you in Japan?
[13:23.240 --> 13:26.960]  OK, good guess.
[13:26.960 --> 13:30.280]  Marco, how about you?
[13:30.280 --> 13:33.280]  And for me, it's 3 p.m.
[13:33.280 --> 13:34.600]  OK, not bad.
[13:34.600 --> 13:37.680]  So you are somewhere from Middle East?
[13:37.680 --> 13:40.160]  Yeah, in Europe.
[13:40.160 --> 13:41.000]  I need that.
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  Europe.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  OK.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.400]  All right, so welcome to the very first session
[13:47.400 --> 13:49.080]  for computer science.
[13:49.080 --> 13:52.920]  We'll be talking to each one of you in a little while.
[13:52.920 --> 13:57.160]  But considering that it may be a little late for some of you,
[13:57.160 --> 14:00.480]  and it may be little too early for others
[14:00.480 --> 14:01.800]  and you may have your own plans.
[14:01.800 --> 14:03.800]  So we will try to keep this meeting short,
[14:03.800 --> 14:07.480]  because it's more about getting to know each other,
[14:07.480 --> 14:10.280]  although we'll also be talking a little bit about the curriculum
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.240]  computer science as a whole as to what
[14:12.240 --> 14:15.640]  all you're going to study over the next two years.
[14:15.640 --> 14:18.880]  But it's more of an interaction with each other
[14:18.880 --> 14:21.640]  so that we get to know each other well.
[14:21.640 --> 14:23.320]  And we will have many other sessions
[14:23.320 --> 14:25.280]  where we'll talk in depth about the curriculum
[14:25.320 --> 14:27.560]  about different topics that we have.
[14:27.560 --> 14:29.080]  So we'll talk about that.
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.960]  But first and foremost, welcome to the very first session.
[14:33.960 --> 14:38.720]  I can see that 14 students and two teachers,
[14:38.720 --> 14:41.400]  I mean, 12 students and two teachers are here.
[14:41.400 --> 14:44.600]  So we'll very shortly start with the presentations
[14:44.600 --> 14:48.120]  that we have developed for you to kind of have
[14:48.120 --> 14:51.760]  a little bit of ice breaking activities.
[14:51.760 --> 14:54.520]  And then we will take you through the Canvas platform,
[14:54.520 --> 14:57.680]  which is the main learning management software
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.440]  that we'll be using for your weekly content assignments.
[15:02.440 --> 15:04.200]  And then we'll also talk about the calendar
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.720]  as to what all will be expected from you during the week.
[15:07.720 --> 15:11.280]  And finally, we will take you through the curriculum map
[15:11.280 --> 15:14.600]  of computer science so that you will be aware as to how
[15:14.600 --> 15:18.200]  we are going to cover the different topics which
[15:18.200 --> 15:19.880]  are prescribed for computer science
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.720]  under the two themes, theme A and theme B.
[15:23.720 --> 15:26.720]  Martin, you ought to add something.
[15:26.720 --> 15:29.080]  Just give you the welcome to the class.
[15:29.080 --> 15:32.920]  Very, very excited to have the opportunity
[15:32.920 --> 15:33.920]  to get to know you.
[15:33.920 --> 15:35.960]  I would like to, for Alman, everybody
[15:35.960 --> 15:38.000]  is that doesn't have the camera on.
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.680]  Just to learn for a little bit is to have a face with your name.
[15:45.680 --> 15:46.400]  Very excited.
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.040]  I hope that we get to do very exciting things
[15:49.040 --> 15:52.360]  through the school year.
[15:52.360 --> 15:53.080]  OK, great.
[15:53.080 --> 15:57.760]  So I can see we have three students still not turned on the camera.
[15:57.760 --> 16:01.880]  I mean, only if it is not possible to turn on for any reasons,
[16:01.880 --> 16:03.120]  then it's quite understandable.
[16:03.120 --> 16:05.000]  But it's an essential agreement between us
[16:05.000 --> 16:08.080]  that for any of the online classes,
[16:08.080 --> 16:11.960]  we would expect that just like the way we have turned on the camera,
[16:11.960 --> 16:14.000]  we would expect that the students should also do that,
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.720]  because that makes interaction more effective.
[16:17.720 --> 16:19.760]  Because we can see your expressions.
[16:19.760 --> 16:21.320]  We can see who you are.
[16:21.320 --> 16:24.680]  And then we can talk to each other.
[16:24.680 --> 16:29.160]  Show me your thumbs if you're ready for today's presentation.
[16:29.160 --> 16:30.160]  Can I see your thumb?
[16:30.160 --> 16:32.400]  Yeah, all right.
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.200]  OK, so welcome once again.
[16:35.200 --> 16:39.040]  So let me quickly share my screen.
[16:39.040 --> 16:42.400]  And by the way, this is the first time
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.040]  we are using this platform, which is online classroom.
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.000]  It's a it's same experience for us,
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.640]  like the way it may be for you.
[16:51.640 --> 16:54.280]  Because this is a new tool that we have adapted
[16:54.280 --> 16:55.360]  for the palm of your lessons.
[16:55.360 --> 16:58.400]  Until the last year, we were using Zoom,
[16:58.400 --> 17:00.600]  which was linked with manage back.
[17:00.600 --> 17:04.840]  But from your batch, I mean, to say from this year onwards,
[17:04.840 --> 17:08.120]  they have switched to a new tool, Canvas,
[17:08.120 --> 17:11.240]  which you know that is an open source learning management system.
[17:11.240 --> 17:18.360]  And this online class is added, is embedded into the system.
[17:18.400 --> 17:22.400]  So we'll be using this for all our online classes.
[17:22.400 --> 17:25.080]  All right, I'll might, it's perfectly fine.
[17:25.080 --> 17:27.480]  No issues at all.
[17:27.480 --> 17:29.920]  So give me a moment to share my screen.
[17:29.920 --> 17:31.920]  And then we'll talk to you about more.
[17:31.920 --> 17:34.400]  This is going to be covered in today's lesson.
[17:34.400 --> 17:36.840]  I'll give you a chance to talk a little later.
[17:36.840 --> 17:37.560]  So let me try.
[17:37.560 --> 17:38.680]  I'll never share my screen.
[17:38.680 --> 17:41.880]  I hope it works on this platform.
[17:41.880 --> 17:52.480]  So entire screen, keeping my fingers crossed
[17:52.480 --> 17:59.760]  that it will allow us to see, can you see my screen?
[17:59.760 --> 18:00.760]  Yes, it's good.
[18:00.760 --> 18:01.920]  Yes.
[18:01.920 --> 18:05.520]  All right, so we have prepared a short presentation
[18:05.520 --> 18:09.000]  for you to just keep things on track.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.680]  And I'm just trying to figure out
[18:10.680 --> 18:12.400]  where the presentation over here it is.
[18:12.400 --> 18:15.040]  So let me put it in the full screen.
[18:27.320 --> 18:30.560]  OK, so meet the computer science team.
[18:30.560 --> 18:31.520]  And this is session one.
[18:31.520 --> 18:33.440]  And we are also going to have more sessions, which
[18:33.440 --> 18:35.800]  will be more of one to one.
[18:35.800 --> 18:38.840]  So we asked teachers would like to meet each one of you.
[18:38.840 --> 18:40.520]  Maybe we'll plan.
[18:40.520 --> 18:43.400]  I mean, you may have seen that there's an assignment, which
[18:43.400 --> 18:45.440]  is to be completed in next four weeks, which
[18:45.440 --> 18:47.560]  is about meeting with your teacher.
[18:47.560 --> 18:49.240]  So we have enough time for doing that.
[18:49.240 --> 18:51.600]  So it's been spread for about four weeks.
[18:51.600 --> 18:55.280]  And we will share with you a calendally tool.
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.840]  I think some of you may have used it in the past.
[18:58.840 --> 19:00.560]  So it is an appointment booking tool.
[19:00.560 --> 19:03.280]  We're in, we will put in our free slots.
[19:03.280 --> 19:07.200]  And by looking at your personal commitments and slots,
[19:07.200 --> 19:10.240]  you can just pick up the one that best suits you.
[19:10.240 --> 19:12.720]  And then we will be meeting with you one to one.
[19:12.720 --> 19:15.480]  But this is the first more informal meeting
[19:15.480 --> 19:18.800]  where we are going to talk to each other about what
[19:18.800 --> 19:21.160]  all is there to be offered as a part of computer science.
[19:21.160 --> 19:23.680]  And we also want to know a little more about here.
[19:23.680 --> 19:29.640]  OK, so there's an interfor today.
[19:29.640 --> 19:32.520]  It's a call ice breaker activity.
[19:32.520 --> 19:35.280]  And then we will introduce ourselves officially to you
[19:35.280 --> 19:38.040]  as to who I am and to Martin S. And we
[19:38.040 --> 19:41.520]  would like to know from you as to where are you placed
[19:41.520 --> 19:43.360]  through a small activity.
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.560]  So where are you located?
[19:44.560 --> 19:48.880]  That will be using a tool for you to mark your location.
[19:48.880 --> 19:52.480]  Then we have online lesson events schedule.
[19:52.480 --> 19:55.920]  So we will take you through the Canvas platform
[19:55.920 --> 19:58.720]  as to what are the things available on the platform
[19:58.720 --> 20:00.320]  and how to access them.
[20:00.320 --> 20:03.000]  We'll show you student calendar or place
[20:03.080 --> 20:06.880]  where you can find your weekly details
[20:06.880 --> 20:08.640]  as to what all needs to be covered during a week.
[20:08.640 --> 20:11.560]  Because sometimes we get lost into so much of information
[20:11.560 --> 20:12.520]  which is there on the canvas.
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.720]  But calendar is a good place where
[20:14.720 --> 20:17.400]  you can find everything in one place.
[20:17.400 --> 20:21.800]  And finally, we'll open the floor for questions and answers.
[20:21.800 --> 20:26.320]  OK, so this is me, Rajesh.
[20:26.320 --> 20:31.440]  And I'm currently based in Southeast Asia
[20:31.440 --> 20:37.680]  in a city called Yangoon, which is in the Myanmar country.
[20:37.680 --> 20:39.920]  So I've just moved here.
[20:39.920 --> 20:42.280]  This is my first year in this place.
[20:42.280 --> 20:46.040]  Before this, I was in Indonesia for about seven years.
[20:46.040 --> 20:48.920]  I was working with an international school in Yangoon,
[20:48.920 --> 20:50.600]  sorry, in Jakarta.
[20:50.600 --> 20:54.240]  And now in my current role, I'm the DP coordinator
[20:54.240 --> 20:56.840]  and also a teacher for computer science
[20:56.840 --> 20:58.840]  for the IBDEP program.
[20:58.840 --> 21:02.160]  I also help students with the theory of knowledge.
[21:02.160 --> 21:06.920]  And besides that, besides my face-to-face responsibilities
[21:06.920 --> 21:10.840]  in the school, I also work in close association
[21:10.840 --> 21:12.640]  with IB on several roles.
[21:12.640 --> 21:16.840]  And that includes, I'm the senior examiner
[21:16.840 --> 21:18.320]  for computer science for paper too.
[21:18.320 --> 21:21.760]  In fact, I'm the assistant principal examiner.
[21:21.760 --> 21:24.280]  I'm also working on different components
[21:24.280 --> 21:27.120]  like I'm a team leader for theory of knowledge.
[21:27.120 --> 21:29.680]  So I take part in the standardizations.
[21:29.680 --> 21:32.680]  And I also set up the examination standards
[21:32.680 --> 21:35.360]  for other examiners to follow.
[21:35.360 --> 21:39.160]  I have also written some papers for computer science.
[21:39.160 --> 21:41.960]  There was a subject called ITGS, Information Technology
[21:41.960 --> 21:47.040]  and Global Society, which now is a digital society in group 3.
[21:47.040 --> 21:49.440]  So I have written few papers for them.
[21:49.440 --> 21:51.880]  I'm also an examiner for A-levels,
[21:51.880 --> 21:53.520]  which they call assessment specialists.
[21:53.520 --> 21:55.280]  So these are some of the additional things
[21:55.280 --> 22:01.560]  that I do besides my routine face-to-face teaching.
[22:01.560 --> 22:03.960]  And we are meeting here because I'm also working
[22:03.960 --> 22:06.160]  with Pamuja as their online facilitator.
[22:06.160 --> 22:08.880]  And quite recently, I've taken up the role
[22:08.880 --> 22:13.360]  for as a course advisor.
[22:13.360 --> 22:17.880]  I also have written in the program
[22:17.880 --> 22:23.360]  for the content that you will see the LMS is co-authored by me
[22:23.360 --> 22:26.480]  and one other colleague of me, his name is Sonal.
[22:26.480 --> 22:30.920]  So we both have worked very hard to compile all the information
[22:30.920 --> 22:36.080]  which will make your learning process convenient.
[22:36.080 --> 22:39.480]  So my favorite CS topic I love coding, not now,
[22:39.480 --> 22:42.000]  but ever since I was a student for computer science
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.560]  during my school days, my college, and even my post graduation.
[22:46.560 --> 22:49.600]  So since then, I have a lot of love for coding.
[22:49.600 --> 22:52.200]  We started with few programming languages
[22:52.200 --> 22:54.200]  which you may probably not even heard of.
[22:54.200 --> 22:59.320]  It's called Fortran, Kobol, List, etc.
[22:59.320 --> 23:03.880]  And then we moved to C, C++, Java, Python, and so on.
[23:03.880 --> 23:07.960]  So that's one of the favorite things that I like to do coding.
[23:07.960 --> 23:10.040]  Favorite programming language, very difficult to say,
[23:10.040 --> 23:12.440]  but since I'm not using those old languages anymore
[23:12.440 --> 23:15.280]  because they are not available, so as for now,
[23:15.320 --> 23:18.240]  Java and Python are the two languages that I like.
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.000]  One of the sports that I love the most is Badminton.
[23:21.000 --> 23:21.960]  I play in my school.
[23:21.960 --> 23:25.640]  I'm also responsible for running a club for Badminton.
[23:25.640 --> 23:29.200]  I love watching cricket because any Indian would love for cricket.
[23:29.200 --> 23:34.680]  So that's into my genes.
[23:34.680 --> 23:37.880]  And my motto is to never give up.
[23:37.880 --> 23:39.480]  I mean, life brings a lot of challenges to us,
[23:39.480 --> 23:41.080]  but as long as you believe in yourself
[23:41.080 --> 23:43.560]  and you have the tendency to not give up,
[23:43.560 --> 23:46.600]  nobody can stop you from being successful.
[23:46.600 --> 23:47.400]  That's about me.
[23:47.400 --> 23:52.400]  And now I would like Martin to introduce himself to you.
[23:54.480 --> 23:55.680]  Well, hello, everybody.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.320]  I'll be your teacher for a couple of classes.
[24:01.320 --> 24:03.840]  My experience as a teacher that has been
[24:03.840 --> 24:06.080]  all my professional career.
[24:06.080 --> 24:08.280]  I started teaching mathematics.
[24:08.280 --> 24:11.080]  I have taught mathematics in different countries,
[24:11.080 --> 24:16.000]  Columbia, Puerto Rico, the US, what I'm based right now.
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  In terms of the IB, I have taught SL and HLAA,
[24:22.040 --> 24:23.880]  and AI, both of them.
[24:23.880 --> 24:26.880]  And then computer science, computer science IB,
[24:26.880 --> 24:31.360]  I have the opportunity to teach the SL classes.
[24:33.080 --> 24:36.480]  And what I love about computer science
[24:36.480 --> 24:38.840]  is how creative you can be.
[24:39.400 --> 24:42.920]  The amazing things that you can actually create and code
[24:42.920 --> 24:46.200]  and how you can approach things in different ways.
[24:47.640 --> 24:49.400]  Obviously, I'm a math geek.
[24:49.400 --> 24:53.560]  So my favorite math topic is calculus.
[24:53.560 --> 24:57.800]  But as Rache mentioned earlier, I also love coding
[24:58.840 --> 25:00.600]  and the different approaches that you can take
[25:00.600 --> 25:02.240]  to solve a problem.
[25:02.240 --> 25:05.320]  I really like Java, but I went through a similar experience.
[25:05.320 --> 25:07.720]  I do remember a little bit of Kabul,
[25:07.720 --> 25:10.720]  I'm basic and I'm fortunate, you know,
[25:10.720 --> 25:13.880]  all languages that, I guess that when you are
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.360]  involving computer science from the edge that we have,
[25:17.360 --> 25:20.560]  then that's what we're exposed to and what we learn.
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.000]  Outlay tennis is still able to move around the court.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.920]  And my dad was a tennis coach,
[25:28.920 --> 25:30.600]  so that's how I learned to play tennis.
[25:30.600 --> 25:32.440]  And I still love it.
[25:33.320 --> 25:35.120]  I had the opportunity as a couple of schools
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.640]  to be a soccer coach also.
[25:37.640 --> 25:39.880]  So I'll follow a soccer.
[25:39.880 --> 25:43.560]  Very glad that Colombia just classified to the World Cup.
[25:43.560 --> 25:46.080]  So I'm very happy about that.
[25:46.080 --> 25:49.760]  And my favorite tennis player is Rafael Nadal.
[25:49.760 --> 25:52.200]  You might probably know about him.
[25:52.200 --> 25:55.480]  I like his intensity, his competitive nature.
[25:55.480 --> 25:58.800]  I think I am that way.
[25:58.800 --> 26:00.320]  I'm very competitive.
[26:01.280 --> 26:05.400]  And my motto is persistence is alone, it's omnipotent.
[26:05.400 --> 26:09.200]  I think that if you decide in your mind to do something,
[26:09.200 --> 26:12.520]  you're going to be able to do it, but you have to persist.
[26:12.520 --> 26:14.480]  You know, you have to persist,
[26:14.480 --> 26:16.400]  no matter what comes, comes your way.
[26:16.400 --> 26:19.600]  But very excited to be here today with you guys.
[26:21.560 --> 26:23.000]  Thank you so much, Martin.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.080]  That's a lovely profile.
[26:24.080 --> 26:27.800]  And I'm glad to be working with you on this course,
[26:27.800 --> 26:31.720]  which is brand new course launched by IB.
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.120]  And we have these students who are the brand ambassadors
[26:35.120 --> 26:38.720]  for this new curriculum, because they are the first ones
[26:38.720 --> 26:40.320]  who would be learning computer science
[26:40.320 --> 26:41.160]  under the new format.
[26:41.160 --> 26:44.920]  So I'm sure that students, you all must be aware
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.480]  that this is brand new course, as I mentioned before.
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.600]  We had the old curriculum which started in the year 2014.
[26:52.600 --> 26:57.320]  And May, 2026 is going to be the last assessment
[26:57.320 --> 27:01.240]  for that earlier curriculum.
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.240]  And starting from May 2025, we are having this new curriculum
[27:05.240 --> 27:10.560]  with the first assessment in May, 2027, which you will be writing.
[27:10.560 --> 27:13.920]  So there have been a lot of wonderful changes
[27:13.920 --> 27:15.560]  in the new curriculum, because you can imagine
[27:15.560 --> 27:18.880]  that how dynamic computer science curriculum is.
[27:18.880 --> 27:22.680]  And the curriculum which was developed way back in 2014
[27:22.680 --> 27:26.360]  was the trends which were popular during that time.
[27:26.360 --> 27:28.480]  But since then, there have been a lot of changes.
[27:28.480 --> 27:31.680]  For example, artificial intelligence, machine learning,
[27:31.680 --> 27:34.800]  which existed even that time, but that was not
[27:34.800 --> 27:39.120]  talked to the extent or used to the extent that we are doing now.
[27:39.120 --> 27:42.080]  So we are glad that computer science new curriculum
[27:42.080 --> 27:44.000]  has been published this year.
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.040]  And you will be benefited by learning all those topics
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.280]  and skills, which actually is covered in most of the universities
[27:53.280 --> 27:56.880]  for the students who pursue computer science majors.
[27:56.960 --> 27:59.920]  So if you are planning to pursue computer science
[27:59.920 --> 28:01.840]  going forward in your university courses,
[28:01.840 --> 28:03.320]  then you will see that a lot of topics
[28:03.320 --> 28:06.040]  that you are going to study over the next two years
[28:06.040 --> 28:08.120]  will actually be the first year course
[28:08.120 --> 28:10.280]  of most of these universities.
[28:10.280 --> 28:13.480]  So it covers all the latest trends,
[28:13.480 --> 28:15.720]  all the latest developments in the field of technology,
[28:15.720 --> 28:18.640]  including computer networks, databases,
[28:18.640 --> 28:21.480]  and all that, we'll talk about that later.
[28:21.480 --> 28:26.680]  OK, so talking a little bit about online
[28:26.680 --> 28:30.520]  lesson events, so weekly online lessons
[28:30.520 --> 28:34.720]  will be conducted to discuss the topic covered each week.
[28:34.720 --> 28:36.520]  Now, just like your school calendar,
[28:36.520 --> 28:40.480]  where the school week normally begins from Monday
[28:40.480 --> 28:43.720]  and goes until Friday, Parmoja follows
[28:43.720 --> 28:46.880]  a little different timeline.
[28:46.880 --> 28:50.200]  So the week for you begins on Wednesday,
[28:50.200 --> 28:52.920]  and then it ends on Tuesday.
[28:52.920 --> 28:54.400]  And this is done with the purpose
[28:54.400 --> 28:57.480]  so that you can have some time during the weekend
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.080]  to finish all your assignments,
[29:01.080 --> 29:04.520]  and then submit them in time giving other students time
[29:04.520 --> 29:07.240]  to respond back to you.
[29:07.240 --> 29:08.960]  And it will also give your teacher time
[29:08.960 --> 29:10.680]  to provide you with a feedback.
[29:10.680 --> 29:12.640]  So it's more of a collaborative study,
[29:12.640 --> 29:15.640]  even though we are distant from each other,
[29:15.640 --> 29:18.320]  several thousand miles from each other.
[29:18.320 --> 29:21.360]  But then the platform is integrated,
[29:21.360 --> 29:23.920]  is integrating students in such a way
[29:23.920 --> 29:26.120]  that you will see a lot of collaboration.
[29:26.120 --> 29:28.480]  And I can see that in the first week only,
[29:28.480 --> 29:32.680]  we have had some wonderful reflections from you
[29:32.680 --> 29:37.360]  in terms of the IB learner profile.
[29:37.360 --> 29:39.600]  And it was really, I was really happy to see,
[29:39.600 --> 29:42.480]  in fact, both of us were happy to read your comments
[29:42.480 --> 29:45.440]  about how you think that Parmoja online learning
[29:45.440 --> 29:48.640]  will develop in you the IB learner profiles.
[29:48.640 --> 29:50.920]  And I was really happy to read the justification
[29:50.920 --> 29:52.680]  that you have given to them.
[29:52.680 --> 29:55.160]  So that is about the weekly lessons.
[29:56.160 --> 29:59.840]  Even though this is an asynchronous course,
[29:59.840 --> 30:04.320]  but then you will see that they will be frequent meetings
[30:04.320 --> 30:05.320]  like these.
[30:06.280 --> 30:10.120]  We are planning to have it almost every weekend.
[30:10.120 --> 30:11.880]  For a simple reason that computer science
[30:11.880 --> 30:14.120]  is a little content-oriented course.
[30:15.400 --> 30:17.560]  And unlike other subjects,
[30:17.560 --> 30:18.640]  which are offered in the online mode,
[30:18.640 --> 30:20.040]  special group three,
[30:20.040 --> 30:23.480]  where students can still study a lot of stuff themselves
[30:23.480 --> 30:25.480]  because it's more subjective in nature.
[30:25.480 --> 30:28.400]  They can study the content and understand.
[30:28.400 --> 30:31.200]  Computer science we believe is a lot more technical
[30:31.200 --> 30:34.000]  where you will be needing our help from time to time.
[30:34.000 --> 30:37.200]  So Martin and I discussed about this.
[30:37.200 --> 30:40.760]  And we thought that we will make it a little more interactive
[30:40.760 --> 30:42.160]  in terms of meeting with you
[30:42.160 --> 30:46.800]  and explaining you weak, long content that you have covered.
[30:46.800 --> 30:49.480]  Now you will be able to benefit from these lessons
[30:49.480 --> 30:53.000]  only when by the time we meet on Saturday or Sunday,
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.920]  you have already read the content
[30:55.920 --> 30:58.760]  which is allocated for each week.
[30:58.760 --> 31:01.200]  If you will only depend on these online lessons
[31:01.200 --> 31:03.240]  which will be about an hour long,
[31:03.240 --> 31:04.960]  I don't think that will be much helpful.
[31:04.960 --> 31:07.360]  So it's going to be more of an interaction between us
[31:07.360 --> 31:09.120]  as to what you have understood.
[31:09.120 --> 31:11.000]  And if there are any difficulties,
[31:11.000 --> 31:12.640]  it will be more like question answer session.
[31:12.640 --> 31:17.640]  Although we will try and take you through the content
[31:18.040 --> 31:19.000]  which has been covered.
[31:19.040 --> 31:21.680]  So we have started preparing the presentations for them.
[31:21.680 --> 31:22.680]  For every week content,
[31:22.680 --> 31:24.600]  we will prepare some detailed presentation
[31:24.600 --> 31:27.320]  and we will share that with you as well.
[31:27.320 --> 31:29.600]  But as I mentioned just now,
[31:29.600 --> 31:31.280]  it would be more effective
[31:31.280 --> 31:36.280]  if we can have these classes in the flipped classroom mode
[31:36.440 --> 31:39.680]  where you come prepared during the online session.
[31:39.680 --> 31:41.680]  And then we also take you through the content.
[31:41.680 --> 31:46.680]  So it will be kind of double coverage
[31:47.440 --> 31:48.640]  where you already have gone through it
[31:48.640 --> 31:50.880]  and we are just revising those topics for you.
[31:50.880 --> 31:52.800]  So it will be more effective.
[31:52.800 --> 31:54.640]  And we also want to take this opportunity
[31:54.640 --> 31:57.640]  to talk about the importance of these lessons
[31:57.640 --> 32:00.400]  because we have seen in the past
[32:00.400 --> 32:03.280]  that students that are enrolled in Phamaja,
[32:03.280 --> 32:06.160]  they take it as a very substitute subject.
[32:06.160 --> 32:09.800]  They're, okay, it's a self-paced learning
[32:09.800 --> 32:11.800]  so we can delay the content for a week or two
[32:11.800 --> 32:13.960]  and maybe we'll try to cover it at a later stage.
[32:14.000 --> 32:15.000]  But let me remind you,
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.720]  since we are right in the beginning of the course
[32:17.720 --> 32:19.000]  that if you ever feel like that,
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.800]  then you will have a lot of difficulties maintaining your grades
[32:22.800 --> 32:25.600]  and also understanding the concepts
[32:25.600 --> 32:26.920]  because it's a very technical subject.
[32:26.920 --> 32:29.320]  It's just like missing two math classes in a row
[32:29.320 --> 32:30.680]  and then you attend a third class.
[32:30.680 --> 32:32.440]  It won't benefit you much.
[32:32.440 --> 32:35.960]  So I would say that you have to study a lot
[32:35.960 --> 32:37.080]  or more than other subjects,
[32:37.080 --> 32:38.520]  but at least give it equal time
[32:38.520 --> 32:39.720]  that you give to other subjects
[32:39.720 --> 32:42.080]  because the computer science course is not easy.
[32:42.080 --> 32:43.040]  It is difficult.
[32:43.040 --> 32:44.960]  Let us tell you that right in the beginning.
[32:44.960 --> 32:48.560]  But if you are regular with your studies,
[32:48.560 --> 32:51.240]  if you're spending enough time going through the content,
[32:51.240 --> 32:53.680]  if you're completing all your assignments,
[32:53.680 --> 32:55.720]  if you're taking part in the discussion
[32:55.720 --> 33:00.160]  in a meaningful way, then it won't be difficult.
[33:00.160 --> 33:01.920]  You will see that it is quite doable,
[33:01.920 --> 33:06.280]  provided you are taking interest in the course.
[33:06.280 --> 33:08.720]  And I'm sure that most of the students who take computer science
[33:08.720 --> 33:10.920]  as their group force subject
[33:10.920 --> 33:13.680]  have some intention of pursuing this
[33:13.680 --> 33:15.320]  in their university level.
[33:15.320 --> 33:17.280]  And if not, they also see the relevance
[33:17.280 --> 33:18.720]  that even if they're going to other fields,
[33:18.720 --> 33:21.320]  for example, medicine or business,
[33:21.320 --> 33:23.080]  they still see a lot of significance
[33:23.080 --> 33:28.080]  of the subject from those domains, right?
[33:28.080 --> 33:30.560]  Martin, you want to add anything?
[33:35.160 --> 33:36.000]  Martin?
[33:37.000 --> 33:46.000]  What I would like to add is that given the level of difficulty
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.840]  of the class, as some of you really mentioned,
[33:49.840 --> 33:51.560]  you have to be proactive.
[33:51.560 --> 33:55.480]  Be proactive and be able to manage your time properly.
[33:55.480 --> 33:59.520]  I think that that is going to be one of the main skills
[33:59.520 --> 34:02.320]  that you are going to use.
[34:03.320 --> 34:07.440]  And you might need to improve on if you already have
[34:07.440 --> 34:10.680]  a method of how to manage your time to be organized,
[34:10.680 --> 34:12.400]  to do things on time.
[34:12.400 --> 34:16.440]  That would be very, very beneficial to you, OK?
[34:16.440 --> 34:19.800]  I'm assuming, obviously, this is not the only class you're taking.
[34:19.800 --> 34:23.320]  You have all the responsibilities, not only a school,
[34:23.320 --> 34:25.080]  but probably outside the school.
[34:25.080 --> 34:27.800]  So time management is going to be key
[34:27.800 --> 34:31.480]  for the success of all of us.
[34:31.480 --> 34:32.200]  Absolutely.
[34:32.200 --> 34:36.360]  And I'm sure that if you have come from MIT background,
[34:36.360 --> 34:38.920]  then you must have heard the terms like ATL skills,
[34:38.920 --> 34:40.840]  the approaches to teaching and learning.
[34:40.840 --> 34:42.560]  And even if you're new to diploma,
[34:42.560 --> 34:46.120]  you will see us talking about those skills often,
[34:46.120 --> 34:48.640]  because this is the time IB is a program which is very
[34:48.640 --> 34:49.800]  rigorous.
[34:49.800 --> 34:52.560]  And very soon, you will see that you will be flooded
[34:52.560 --> 34:55.480]  with a lot of deadlines, a lot of submissions.
[34:55.480 --> 34:58.920]  But if you are good with the time management skills,
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.000]  and if you take things in an appropriate way
[35:03.000 --> 35:06.400]  and timely manner, then things are quite easy.
[35:06.400 --> 35:09.920]  The students who push things for later date
[35:09.920 --> 35:13.280]  or push it for future are the ones who actually struggle a lot.
[35:13.280 --> 35:15.800]  So if you are good with the time management skills,
[35:15.800 --> 35:18.160]  then things are going to be easy for you.
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.240]  OK, about the online classes, we totally understand
[35:20.240 --> 35:22.920]  that sometimes it may not be possible for you
[35:22.920 --> 35:25.760]  to attend it in the synchronous way.
[35:25.760 --> 35:29.960]  But in such cases, we would really expect you
[35:29.960 --> 35:32.520]  to be informing us in advance.
[35:32.520 --> 35:35.360]  So like the way we shared with you a survey,
[35:35.360 --> 35:37.920]  where you indicated whether you are attending or not,
[35:37.920 --> 35:40.280]  we will be sharing that with you every week
[35:40.280 --> 35:42.440]  before the actual session.
[35:42.440 --> 35:44.840]  And in case if you're not able to attend for any reason,
[35:44.840 --> 35:47.440]  which is quite understandable, you can mention in that
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.760]  with the proper reason, because we will be compiling all those
[35:51.760 --> 35:54.960]  responses and sharing with the school site-based coordinator.
[35:55.920 --> 35:58.680]  I'm sure you must be aware who the site-based coordinator
[35:58.680 --> 36:00.720]  is in your school for palmaja.
[36:00.720 --> 36:03.680]  So they will be getting all these reports from us
[36:03.680 --> 36:07.040]  so that they will be aware that what extent
[36:07.040 --> 36:10.600]  or at what frequency you are attending these classes.
[36:10.600 --> 36:13.320]  Attendance will be trapped and reported to the SPC,
[36:13.320 --> 36:14.760]  as I just mentioned.
[36:14.760 --> 36:17.120]  And these sessions are valuable opportunity
[36:17.120 --> 36:20.560]  to clarify doubts, share ideas, and stay connected
[36:20.560 --> 36:22.840]  with your peers and teachers.
[36:22.920 --> 36:26.280]  Because face-to-face classroom has a lot of benefits
[36:26.280 --> 36:29.040]  that the teachers meet the students every day.
[36:29.040 --> 36:30.720]  They have direct interactions.
[36:30.720 --> 36:35.320]  But in this mode, we will not be meeting that frequently.
[36:35.320 --> 36:37.440]  In fact, in other courses in palmaja,
[36:37.440 --> 36:39.680]  those students don't meet the facilitators
[36:39.680 --> 36:42.360]  for let's say months or even two months.
[36:42.360 --> 36:45.480]  But we have tried making some changes in that approach
[36:45.480 --> 36:48.400]  and we will be meeting you more frequently,
[36:48.400 --> 36:49.280]  at least once a week.
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.080]  Sometimes maybe once or twice more.
[36:53.080 --> 36:56.000]  But as a general practice, we'll be meeting you
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.440]  at least once a week.
[36:57.440 --> 37:00.320]  And that will be the time when we will reflect
[37:00.320 --> 37:03.040]  on whatever content you have covered during the week.
[37:03.040 --> 37:04.880]  That will also be an opportunity for you
[37:04.880 --> 37:07.280]  to clarify any doubts.
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.120]  So while revising any topic or while reading any content,
[37:11.120 --> 37:14.880]  if you have any questions, obviously you can post them
[37:14.880 --> 37:19.080]  to us in the discussion or even you can send us an email
[37:20.120 --> 37:21.320]  using this platform.
[37:21.320 --> 37:23.240]  We'll show you how to do that.
[37:23.240 --> 37:27.880]  But what I see more beneficial is that you can make a note
[37:27.880 --> 37:30.800]  of those questions and bring during the lessons
[37:30.800 --> 37:33.200]  so that it will benefit even others.
[37:33.200 --> 37:35.360]  So if you have some query, it's possible
[37:35.360 --> 37:37.680]  that others may also have similar queries.
[37:37.680 --> 37:39.920]  So if you bring them during the online lessons,
[37:39.920 --> 37:43.760]  it will benefit each and every person in the row.
[37:43.760 --> 37:47.160]  All right, so now Martin and I have spoken a lot.
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.440]  So it's your turn now.
[37:49.440 --> 37:51.760]  So as I mentioned that we are going to use a tool
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.160]  for you to mark your location on the world map
[37:55.160 --> 37:58.680]  for us to see how diverse we are
[37:58.680 --> 38:00.920]  in terms of geographical locations,
[38:00.920 --> 38:03.240]  how far we are from each other.
[38:03.240 --> 38:07.240]  So let me share with you one link in the chat.
[38:07.240 --> 38:10.080]  And I will explain you how to use that.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.200]  So there is this tool called
[38:15.040 --> 38:23.040]  Z-Maps, okay, and I'll put a link in the chat.
[38:25.200 --> 38:27.320]  Let me go to the chat, I'll put a link here.
[38:27.320 --> 38:32.320]  Okay, I have posted a link, can you see that in the chat?
[38:58.160 --> 38:59.920]  Martin, you can see.
[38:59.920 --> 39:00.760]  Yes, I can see.
[39:00.760 --> 39:01.680]  Okay, okay.
[39:01.680 --> 39:03.760]  So if you could go to this link,
[39:06.200 --> 39:08.200]  you should be able to see this page.
[39:10.600 --> 39:12.880]  I'll give you 30 seconds to load this page
[39:12.880 --> 39:14.800]  so that we all are doing it together.
[39:16.600 --> 39:17.440]  Rush.
[39:20.320 --> 39:23.520]  The guest invite link didn't work.
[39:23.520 --> 39:26.640]  I have a couple of notifications from my students
[39:26.640 --> 39:27.960]  from the other session.
[39:27.960 --> 39:31.680]  They were not able to join the meeting.
[39:31.680 --> 39:32.680]  For really?
[39:32.680 --> 39:33.960]  Yeah.
[39:33.960 --> 39:38.120]  So I just told them that the session is being recorded
[39:38.120 --> 39:40.560]  so that they can watch the recording later
[39:40.560 --> 39:42.640]  or I might meet with them later on.
[39:43.720 --> 39:48.040]  Has anyone joined here with the guest link
[39:48.040 --> 39:49.680]  or everybody has joined through main class?
[39:49.680 --> 39:52.440]  Oh, somebody, yeah, somebody, Jason.
[39:53.320 --> 39:57.240]  Uh, Jason, have you joined using a link?
[39:59.200 --> 40:02.000]  They, how many of you link them?
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.040]  How many of you are from SL class?
[40:08.840 --> 40:13.160]  Since I can't see the camera, can you just put your name
[40:13.160 --> 40:15.680]  in the chat if you're from SL class?
[40:15.680 --> 40:19.080]  We're just trying to see if that guest link is working.
[40:20.080 --> 40:21.680]  Okay, no.
[40:21.680 --> 40:24.480]  Jason is just saying that she was able to see them up.
[40:25.440 --> 40:27.760]  Okay, then if somebody, if one person is able to join
[40:27.760 --> 40:29.400]  then others should also be able to join.
[40:29.400 --> 40:30.240]  I'm not sure.
[40:30.240 --> 40:32.200]  No, she's not saying that.
[40:32.200 --> 40:33.560]  She just saying that.
[40:33.560 --> 40:35.320]  Oh, she joined from class.
[40:35.320 --> 40:36.160]  Right, right.
[40:36.160 --> 40:37.360]  So I don't think that, um,
[40:37.360 --> 40:40.120]  because I have received several notifications
[40:40.120 --> 40:43.800]  that they will, they're not able to, to join.
[40:44.360 --> 40:48.720]  Uh, can we, can we do one thing, uh, Martin?
[40:48.720 --> 40:52.280]  Um, yeah, I'll just copy this guest link again.
[40:53.080 --> 40:56.440]  Can you open this in some other browser and see if you're able
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.240]  to join by the time I get this, uh, okay.
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.440]  Let me try, yeah, try this.
[41:01.440 --> 41:04.040]  I don't see any reason why it should not work because.
[41:04.960 --> 41:07.800]  Or is it asking for permission if our guest is there?
[41:07.800 --> 41:09.480]  Do we have to permit them somewhere?
[41:09.480 --> 41:10.680]  Uh, let me see.
[41:10.840 --> 41:14.840]  Um, do you have the link the best, uh,
[41:14.840 --> 41:17.120]  the guest in by link on the main class?
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.600]  I've just put it in the chat also.
[41:22.520 --> 41:23.040]  Okay.
[41:25.080 --> 41:27.880]  Try to open this in some other browser and say if it is at least
[41:27.880 --> 41:31.840]  taking you to, uh, to the classroom.
[41:32.360 --> 41:33.240]  Okay, let's see.
[41:33.240 --> 41:37.040]  Okay, in the meantime, I hope that everybody is able to be on this page.
[41:37.280 --> 41:40.040]  So what do you need to do is you can see that there are two location,
[41:40.040 --> 41:43.440]  uh, uh, points, which are only, uh, on the map.
[41:43.440 --> 41:49.640]  So one is me here in Myanmar and one is here, um, um,
[41:50.360 --> 41:52.640]  Martin from Texas.
[41:53.280 --> 41:58.560]  Now, how you can add your location pin is by going to, uh,
[41:59.320 --> 42:06.800]  edition, please tap the third option, edition and pick up the first one in the
[42:06.800 --> 42:09.720]  drop down at marker, simple.
[42:11.680 --> 42:14.080]  So when you go here, just mention your name.
[42:14.800 --> 42:17.360]  I'll do it myself, I, I'll do it for myself once again.
[42:17.360 --> 42:20.120]  So I say Rajesh and location.
[42:20.600 --> 42:24.840]  As I type young, it will show me this country names or you can pick up a pick up
[42:24.840 --> 42:29.240]  the one, uh, that best, uh, defines your location.
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.400]  And after having done that, you just have to click on submit.
[42:34.880 --> 42:39.560]  So you have given your name, you have mentioned your location and then just
[42:39.560 --> 42:44.600]  submit and then it will give this new entry as a minority and just close it,
[42:44.960 --> 42:45.480]  close here.
[42:48.840 --> 42:52.480]  Yeah, 30 seconds to complete this by the time I'll figure out that, yeah,
[42:52.480 --> 42:54.440]  I can see the inputs coming in.
[42:59.520 --> 43:00.880]  Martin, any luck with that?
[43:01.520 --> 43:03.920]  Uh, I was able to use the link you provided.
[43:03.920 --> 43:07.120]  I'm going to paste it on an announcement right now again.
[43:07.200 --> 43:08.200]  Yeah, please do that.
[43:08.320 --> 43:09.240]  Yeah, that would be great.
[43:09.240 --> 43:09.760]  Yes.
[43:09.960 --> 43:10.360]  All right.
[43:15.080 --> 43:18.560]  Yeah, that would be great because it will be good if they're waiting,
[43:18.560 --> 43:21.360]  that it will be good if they're going to come and join the life class.
[43:22.200 --> 43:24.560]  Just put it in the SL announcements.
[43:34.400 --> 43:38.840]  Okay, so you can see the different regions we come from.
[43:38.840 --> 43:49.320]  So we have from Namibia, we have, uh, U-A-E cypress, we have Austria,
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.760]  we have Milan, Switzerland, Austria,
[44:00.440 --> 44:02.920]  Lithuania, or close to that.
[44:04.920 --> 44:05.920]  What's this place?
[44:06.920 --> 44:08.920]  Vilnius, okay.
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.920]  Uh, then we have Estonia.
[44:15.920 --> 44:16.920]  Norway.
[44:17.920 --> 44:18.920]  Norway.
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.920]  So see how diverse, uh, set of group we are.
[44:22.920 --> 44:24.920]  We are almost everywhere.
[44:24.920 --> 44:26.920]  We have Mexico.
[44:29.920 --> 44:31.920]  We have Namibia.
[44:31.920 --> 44:33.920]  We have Bangkok.
[44:35.920 --> 44:36.920]  Sorry, you know, that's Myanmar.
[44:36.920 --> 44:38.920]  We don't have anyone from Thailand.
[44:38.920 --> 44:40.920]  We have Japan.
[44:40.920 --> 44:43.920]  So almost all parts of the world.
[44:43.920 --> 44:45.920]  And that is the beauty of these online classes.
[44:45.920 --> 44:50.920]  I mean, you can never imagine such diverse range of students within your face to face class.
[44:50.920 --> 44:52.920]  But look at these locations.
[44:52.920 --> 44:56.920]  I mean, we are almost all parts of the world.
[44:56.920 --> 45:00.920]  So that is what make these classes very, very special because.
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.920]  The kind of perspectives that will be coming in from each one of you that will actually, uh,
[45:05.920 --> 45:09.920]  that is something that makes these lessons so very important.
[45:09.920 --> 45:12.920]  So thank you for your inputs.
[45:12.920 --> 45:15.920]  Now, one thing more, since you are already entering something,
[45:15.920 --> 45:18.920]  so I would like to take your attendance.
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.920]  Uh, for that, I will give you.
[45:22.920 --> 45:23.920]  A link.
[45:25.920 --> 45:28.920]  And you should be able to mark your attendance.
[45:28.920 --> 45:33.920]  So I'll put it here in the chat again.
[45:35.920 --> 45:37.920]  So go to this Google form.
[45:37.920 --> 45:39.920]  Microsoft form.
[45:39.920 --> 45:41.920]  And then.
[45:41.920 --> 45:43.920]  You will be able to see.
[45:43.920 --> 45:51.920]  First of all, you have to select the name of the teacher.
[45:51.920 --> 45:53.920]  You should select the name of your teacher.
[45:53.920 --> 45:58.920]  So I'm teaching grade section a mountain is teaching B and SL.
[45:58.920 --> 46:04.920]  I don't think we have anyone in SL so far, but all those who are in section B can choose this.
[46:04.920 --> 46:11.920]  Those who are in section A can choose this go next and just select your name and then submit.
[46:12.920 --> 46:14.920]  That will let us have your attendance.
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.920]  Let me know if you face any difficulties in marking your attendance.
[46:41.920 --> 46:49.920]  We have three responses so far to the farm.
[47:12.920 --> 47:16.920]  Eight plus two 10. So we have 10 so far.
[47:19.920 --> 47:20.920]  Your Martin, you're right.
[47:20.920 --> 47:23.920]  There's nobody from SL class as yet.
[47:23.920 --> 47:24.920]  Yeah.
[47:24.920 --> 47:30.920]  I shared the link already, but I haven't seen any new people logging in.
[47:30.920 --> 47:32.920]  Yeah, just keep an eye on that.
[47:32.920 --> 47:36.920]  If anybody else joins in, we'll share with them that link to.
[47:36.920 --> 47:39.920]  Z maps and then this attendance as well.
[47:42.920 --> 47:43.920]  15.
[47:43.920 --> 47:44.920]  Sorry.
[47:44.920 --> 47:54.920]  I was trying to mark my attendance, but once I put my like session section and then my name.
[47:54.920 --> 47:58.920]  It sends me to section B.
[47:58.920 --> 48:00.920]  Is it?
[48:00.920 --> 48:07.920]  Yeah, so you can still go next and then just go to the laboratory question.
[48:07.920 --> 48:09.920]  Or is it?
[48:09.920 --> 48:13.920]  How come others are able to do them?
[48:13.920 --> 48:15.920]  Hello, are you able to hear me?
[48:15.920 --> 48:16.920]  Yeah.
[48:16.920 --> 48:17.920]  Yes.
[48:17.920 --> 48:18.920]  I'd like to clarify.
[48:18.920 --> 48:19.920]  I had the same issue.
[48:19.920 --> 48:22.920]  I just said my name isn't on the list and I submitted it.
[48:22.920 --> 48:24.920]  Okay.
[48:24.920 --> 48:28.920]  Or you didn't have your name in the list and did you mention your name?
[48:28.920 --> 48:31.920]  I put my name in the first section in Mr. Martin's HL class.
[48:31.920 --> 48:36.920]  And then when it sent me to the SL class, I just put my name is not there.
[48:36.920 --> 48:37.920]  Okay, that's fine.
[48:37.920 --> 48:38.920]  Yeah, you can do the same thing.
[48:38.920 --> 48:45.920]  I'll modify them form so that next time that problem doesn't stay.
[48:45.920 --> 48:47.920]  So go to the next one and put your.
[48:47.920 --> 48:50.920]  My name is not in the list and just put your name.
[48:50.920 --> 48:53.920]  And go next.
[48:53.920 --> 48:57.920]  Okay, so I think we have all the names in 15 plus 270.
[48:57.920 --> 49:00.920]  And that's pretty much the number that we have now.
[49:00.920 --> 49:02.920]  All right, so thank you for marking your attendance.
[49:02.920 --> 49:05.920]  Now we'd like to hear from some of you.
[49:05.920 --> 49:13.920]  About the reason why you have chosen computer science as a subject to push you in your diploma program.
[49:13.920 --> 49:16.920]  Despite that it is not offered in your school.
[49:16.920 --> 49:20.920]  So we I don't want to call the names anybody who would like to just jump in and.
[49:20.920 --> 49:29.920]  Just give some reasons as to why you have picked up this subject as one of your group for subjects.
[49:29.920 --> 49:30.920]  Anyone?
[49:30.920 --> 49:32.920]  Do we have any risk taker?
[49:35.920 --> 49:40.920]  Thomas, I see you're unmuted.
[49:40.920 --> 49:45.920]  So maybe you can start.
[49:45.920 --> 49:51.920]  Go ahead and unmute yourself.
[49:51.920 --> 49:53.920]  Thomas, I think you're already unmuted.
[49:53.920 --> 49:57.920]  So you can just talk.
[49:57.920 --> 50:03.920]  And what what made you choose computer science for your group for subject?
[50:03.920 --> 50:11.920]  I chose it due to the fact that I have always found the computer science interesting.
[50:11.920 --> 50:17.920]  And the fact that it's becoming more prevalent in your time.
[50:17.920 --> 50:18.920]  Yeah, right.
[50:18.920 --> 50:19.920]  So, okay.
[50:19.920 --> 50:23.920]  So that's a good reason to choose computer science.
[50:23.920 --> 50:32.920]  We need two more students to just talk to us about the reasons why they have taken computer science.
[50:32.920 --> 50:33.920]  Hello guys.
[50:33.920 --> 50:34.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:34.920 --> 50:35.920]  Sophia, please go ahead.
[50:35.920 --> 50:42.920]  Sophia, sorry.
[50:42.920 --> 50:44.920]  And we can hear.
[50:44.920 --> 50:46.920]  We can't hear you.
[50:46.920 --> 50:50.920]  I think you're unmuted, but we can't hear you.
[50:50.920 --> 50:54.920]  Maybe microphone, microphone.
[50:54.920 --> 50:57.920]  It could be.
[50:57.920 --> 51:03.920]  Yeah, now we can't hear you unfortunately.
[51:03.920 --> 51:04.920]  It happens.
[51:04.920 --> 51:07.920]  I mean, there are some, sometimes there are technical issues.
[51:07.920 --> 51:11.920]  So, but anyway, we are glad that you came forward to talk about.
[51:11.920 --> 51:15.920]  Maybe if the microphone works, you can jump in at some other time and talk about it.
[51:15.920 --> 51:16.920]  Okay.
[51:16.920 --> 51:23.920]  So, after Sophia, who is the next code, I'd like to talk.
[51:23.920 --> 51:27.920]  Ricardo.
[51:27.920 --> 51:28.920]  Okay.
[51:28.920 --> 51:34.920]  So, I chose computer science because firstly, I like it.
[51:34.920 --> 51:42.920]  But also because I think it is very important for my future and for my future career.
[51:42.920 --> 51:45.920]  So, are you planning to pursue computer science?
[51:45.920 --> 51:46.920]  Yes.
[51:46.920 --> 51:47.920]  Great.
[51:47.920 --> 51:48.920]  Lovely.
[51:48.920 --> 51:51.920]  So, this course is going to be a very beneficial for you.
[51:51.920 --> 51:54.920]  I can say that with full confidence.
[51:54.920 --> 51:56.920]  Welcome to the class, Ricardo.
[51:56.920 --> 51:57.920]  Thank you.
[51:57.920 --> 52:00.920]  One more, one more student.
[52:00.920 --> 52:10.920]  I mean, the reasons are pretty much the same for all, but we just want to give you some voice to talk to us about the reasons why you have computer science.
[52:10.920 --> 52:13.920]  Marco.
[52:13.920 --> 52:15.920]  So, can you hear me?
[52:15.920 --> 52:16.920]  Yes.
[52:16.920 --> 52:20.920]  So, I chose computer science also because I really like it.
[52:20.920 --> 52:32.920]  And because I'd like to go to a university and also do like with coding or something like that.
[52:32.920 --> 52:33.920]  Okay.
[52:33.920 --> 52:39.920]  And also, for my job, like, yeah, I'd like to continue.
[52:39.920 --> 52:40.920]  Yeah.
[52:40.920 --> 52:41.920]  That's great.
[52:41.920 --> 52:42.920]  Thanks, Marco, for sharing that.
[52:42.920 --> 52:53.920]  Now, we would like to know from each one of you, not through the microphone, but you can use the chat to say yes or no for any past coding experience.
[52:53.920 --> 52:58.920]  If you have done coding before, you can just mention the language that you have done.
[52:58.920 --> 53:01.920]  If between Pike and our Java, good.
[53:01.920 --> 53:07.920]  Otherwise, any other language, even if you have done some coding in scratch, could you please mention that in the chat.
[53:07.920 --> 53:14.920]  And if you have never done coding and this is the first time you're doing, that also can be mentioned in the chat.
[53:14.920 --> 53:21.920]  So, you can say either none or you can name the language that you have used for coding.
[53:21.920 --> 53:23.920]  Yes, type it on the chat.
[53:23.920 --> 53:25.920]  Thomas, you have a question.
[53:25.920 --> 53:27.920]  Type it on the chat.
[53:27.920 --> 53:28.920]  Okay.
[53:28.920 --> 53:30.920]  So, Lauren knows.
[53:30.920 --> 53:32.920]  Lauren, so say it's none.
[53:32.920 --> 53:34.920]  Fine.
[53:34.920 --> 53:37.920]  We don't have chat.
[53:37.920 --> 53:38.920]  You don't have chat.
[53:38.920 --> 53:43.920]  We can't write some chats that things have been disabled.
[53:43.920 --> 53:47.920]  So.
[53:47.920 --> 53:51.920]  Yeah, same issue chat is disabled.
[53:51.920 --> 53:52.920]  Okay.
[53:52.920 --> 53:54.920]  Really?
[53:54.920 --> 53:57.920]  But I just saw somebody writing none. How did they write?
[53:57.920 --> 54:00.920]  It's all the public chat doesn't work.
[54:00.920 --> 54:01.920]  It's been disabled.
[54:01.920 --> 54:03.920]  The private chat is always one to one.
[54:03.920 --> 54:05.920]  So there must be some setting somewhere.
[54:05.920 --> 54:10.920]  See, we are also learning with you because we have never used this platform before.
[54:10.920 --> 54:11.920]  Okay.
[54:11.920 --> 54:13.920]  Okay, fine.
[54:13.920 --> 54:15.920]  So public channel is not available with you.
[54:15.920 --> 54:17.920]  So there must be a way to do it.
[54:17.920 --> 54:21.920]  Do you have a choice to check to check the what channel you want?
[54:21.920 --> 54:27.920]  Because I see that there are everyone features and so choose everyone and see if that.
[54:27.920 --> 54:29.920]  Okay, so Thomas says it works now.
[54:29.920 --> 54:31.920]  So I think it's working now.
[54:31.920 --> 54:33.920]  You can use the chat option.
[54:33.920 --> 54:37.920]  I believe Thomas mentioned it's it's working.
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.920]  Yeah, could you could you please write in the chat if it's Thomas.
[54:41.920 --> 54:45.920]  Can you try it's working still or I don't know what I did.
[54:45.920 --> 54:46.920]  It came on its own.
[54:46.920 --> 54:47.920]  Yeah, okay.
[54:47.920 --> 54:48.920]  Yeah, it's working.
[54:48.920 --> 54:53.920]  So could you please mention there the programming language that you are familiar with.
[54:53.920 --> 54:56.920]  And if not, then just say none for your name.
[54:56.920 --> 55:02.920]  We are just trying to collect some data because it will largely depend on your current proficiency.
[55:02.920 --> 55:04.920]  That how we plan our lessons for programming.
[55:04.920 --> 55:09.920]  So it's important for us to know.
[55:09.920 --> 55:10.920]  Scratch.
[55:10.920 --> 55:11.920]  Okay.
[55:11.920 --> 55:12.920]  Alma.
[55:12.920 --> 55:13.920]  Scratch.
[55:13.920 --> 55:14.920]  Three years CSS.
[55:14.920 --> 55:15.920]  JS HTML.
[55:15.920 --> 55:16.920]  One year Python.
[55:16.920 --> 55:17.920]  Okay.
[55:17.920 --> 55:20.920]  That will be very helpful.
[55:20.920 --> 55:23.920]  Stephens.
[55:23.920 --> 55:24.920]  Yes, for fun.
[55:24.920 --> 55:26.920]  Yeah, computer science is all about fun.
[55:26.920 --> 55:27.920]  It's good.
[55:27.920 --> 55:29.920]  Even if you have done the coding for fun.
[55:29.920 --> 55:31.920]  Python, Java HTML.
[55:31.920 --> 55:32.920]  Java C++.
[55:32.920 --> 55:33.920]  Python.
[55:33.920 --> 55:34.920]  All right.
[55:34.920 --> 55:40.920]  So we can see that we have mixed group of students where some of you have never done it in the past.
[55:40.920 --> 55:44.920]  And some of you have done quite a number of languages.
[55:44.920 --> 55:50.920]  So that is where the collaboration plays a very important role because we will be needing each other's help.
[55:50.920 --> 55:58.920]  So we will make sure that everybody learns because right now all the students that are attending this lesson are enrolled for HL.
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.920]  And technically, I B, if you look at the IV subject guide, it says that computer science should be studied by the students.
[56:04.920 --> 56:09.920]  If they have done some sort of programming in the past, especially for the HL classes.
[56:09.920 --> 56:16.920]  But then we don't discourage students from learning because we know that if you have the commitment, if you have the passion, you can start learning at any age.
[56:16.920 --> 56:19.920]  It will require a little bit of additional efforts from you if you have never done before.
[56:19.920 --> 56:29.920]  So I would strongly recommend that by the time we reach to the programming practices, you can just start learning the programming yourself using a lot of online tutorials are there.
[56:29.920 --> 56:32.920]  You just Google that online tutorial for Java.
[56:32.920 --> 56:38.920]  And you will see that there will be plenty of websites like W3 schools or what's that Martin.
[56:38.920 --> 56:41.920]  There's one great code or something.
[56:41.920 --> 56:43.920]  There is one that I like.
[56:43.920 --> 56:58.920]  So we'll make a list of these some of the tools which you can find useful and you can start learning programming because we want you to be familiar with the language before we jump on with the programming section.
[56:58.920 --> 57:01.920]  It will be beneficial to you.
[57:01.920 --> 57:04.920]  Alright, so let's move on back to the presentation.
[57:04.920 --> 57:14.920]  So we'll having known about you and you having known about us is the time for us to know about the curriculum as to what all we are going to study.
[57:14.920 --> 57:19.920]  I won't be spending too much time on that because we will have exclusive sessions for them.
[57:19.920 --> 57:27.920]  But then just to give you an idea about what all is contained in computer science curriculum, I will just go through the presentation.
[57:27.920 --> 57:40.920]  And before we do that, does anyone know what are you going to study over the next two years as a part of CS course anyone.
[57:40.920 --> 57:47.920]  Have you looked at the curriculum as to what all is covered in the two years course.
[57:47.920 --> 57:49.920]  Or you have not seen yet.
[57:49.920 --> 57:52.920]  Just raise your hand so we know how many of you.
[57:52.920 --> 57:54.920]  That would be great.
[57:54.920 --> 57:57.920]  Yeah.
[57:57.920 --> 58:02.920]  Okay, so two, four.
[58:02.920 --> 58:07.920]  Alright, so four of you.
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.920]  Zach, Zach, is that correct pronunciation?
[58:12.920 --> 58:16.920]  What do you know about the curriculum since you raise your hand?
[58:16.920 --> 58:18.920]  Could you tell us?
[58:18.920 --> 58:24.920]  So I reviewed the IBCS HL curriculum first assessment 2027.
[58:24.920 --> 58:25.920]  Yeah.
[58:25.920 --> 58:35.920]  Did a bit of preparation for the two themes, theme A and theme B and just went over compiling the resources all need throughout the year.
[58:35.920 --> 58:37.920]  Yeah, right.
[58:37.920 --> 58:38.920]  Yeah.
[58:38.920 --> 58:40.920]  So we have as the.
[58:40.920 --> 58:41.920]  How do you pronounce your name?
[58:41.920 --> 58:42.920]  Zachar.
[58:42.920 --> 58:43.920]  Is it Zachar?
[58:44.920 --> 58:45.920]  Zachar.
[58:45.920 --> 58:49.920]  Okay, as Zachar mentioned that the course is split into two different parts.
[58:49.920 --> 58:52.920]  One is a thing A and one is theme B.
[58:52.920 --> 58:56.920]  And that is a major change from the old syllabus because in old syllabus.
[58:56.920 --> 58:59.920]  There was paper one and paper two, which we still have.
[58:59.920 --> 59:04.920]  But in paper two, student had to choose one from four different options.
[59:04.920 --> 59:06.920]  But now that I be has done away with.
[59:06.920 --> 59:08.920]  So it's a common curriculum across the globe.
[59:08.920 --> 59:11.920]  So everybody would study exactly the same curriculum.
[59:11.920 --> 59:14.920]  Because it used to differ from one school to another.
[59:14.920 --> 59:17.920]  But now it's a common curriculum, which is a good change actually.
[59:17.920 --> 59:21.920]  Yeah, so let me take you back to the presentation and we quickly go through.
[59:21.920 --> 59:26.920]  The slides to see that what all is covered as a part of computer science course.
[59:26.920 --> 59:31.920]  And then we will open the floor for question other sessions.
[59:31.920 --> 59:32.920]  Fine.
[59:32.920 --> 59:40.920]  So let me put it in the full screen mode.
[59:40.920 --> 59:46.920]  So I did a computer science assessment online first assessment in May 2027.
[59:46.920 --> 59:51.920]  We will talk about the AI because as you have just started with the course,
[59:51.920 --> 59:57.920]  just spend 30 seconds to read through what AI is all about and what AI should not be used for.
[59:57.920 --> 01:00:04.920]  I'm sure that your school diploma coordinator and other teachers may already have spoken to you about.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:08.920]  How strictly I be takes in terms of usage of AI.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:14.920]  I be doesn't discourage students from using AI because it's a powerful tool for you in the learning process.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:24.920]  But there are some terms and conditions which we have to abide by to see that we are not using AI in appropriately.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:30.920]  So AI should not be used to writing assessments essays or assignments on your behalf.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.920]  And unlike your face to face school where all your assessments are done in presence of your teacher.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:43.920]  Here except for few, most of the assessments will have to be done by you under your own supervision.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.920]  So that is where the academic integrity and academic honesty plays a major role.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:57.920]  And let me tell you, I know that you will not be using it, but this learning platform is already embedded with the AI detection tools.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:07.920]  So if there are any submissions which shows a good amount of AI usage, students generally get one written warning.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:14.920]  And after that matter is escalated to the higher authorities and that will be a problematic and we don't want you to be getting into that.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:22.920]  So please don't use AI for any purpose, which is outlined here under the second category.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:30.920]  Generating citations, references or data without verification, replacing your own critical thinking analysis or creativity.
[01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:43.920]  That is the most important part because the more you start using AI, the more difficulty you are making for yourself in terms of developing critical thinking skills, skills of analysis and your creativity skills.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:51.920]  So it's good for you if you are less dependent on AI and more dependent on your own personal thoughts.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:02:05.920]  Remember, using AI responsibly means applying it as a support tool, not substituting your own work, misuse can result in an academic dishonesty and lead to serious consequences.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:19.920]  So this is just a warning and I know that you all are responsible students and that's when we have a declaration submission from you to say that you will never use any such thing which will lead to academic dishonesty.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:26.920]  Okay, so we have essentially four assessment objectives, but I think this is not the right time to talk about them right now.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:37.920]  We just want to talk to you about the curriculum structure as the water is going to be covered and then in further sessions will talk more about what assessment objectives are and about the internal assessment.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.920]  So this is anyways will cover this little later.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.920]  This also will come later. Okay, so this is something important for you.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:55.920]  So as a part of computer science course for SL and national both we have two written papers paper one which carries 50% weightage overall paper.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:07.920]  Sorry, not weightage paper one 50% for assessment objective one and two and 50% for assessment objective three and paper two same thing 50% plus 50%.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:15.920]  And I a covers four assessment objectives, but we'll come to this assessment objective business a little later.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:24.920]  So as it was mentioned by one of you that the syllabus is organized into two main themes one is team A and one is team B.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.920]  So Martin, you would like to talk a little about team A and team B.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:38.920]  I'm being charged of theme B correct. I both.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:52.920]  Yeah, so yeah, so essentially the computer science courses divided into teams theme A is basically the theoretical concept about the computer science and that includes four topics.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:04:02.920]  So I think it will be covered in the next slide, but there are four topics which are going to be studied as part of theme A and theme B is all about programming.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:17.920]  So paper one will be based on theme A and paper two will be based on theme B for both SL and HL they will share the same core content, but for HL they will be some additional topics for the greater depth.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:28.920]  And for that very reason the total hours allocated for SL is 150 hours and HL is 240 and this is where it comes theme A and theme B.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:36.920]  You can see in theme A we have four topics which is computer fundamentals where you will be learning about different components of computer system.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:49.920]  For example, CPU GPU RAM ROM registers and then also it includes the number system binary number system exit a simple number system logic gates.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:55.920]  So all those things are covered in theme A and if you have looked at week two content.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:03.920]  I don't know if you have the access to week two content, but in week two you will see that we will begin with theme A computer fundamentals.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:14.920]  Second topic is computer networks, which is essentially everything about computer network in many different forms like LAN, man, van, VPN OSI layer model.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:21.920]  So everything related to network will be covered as a part of a two or the third topic is databases.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:31.920]  So that is also part of theme A. Now this databases chapter will be very important from you from the for you from the internal assessment point of view.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:37.920]  So we'll be talking about internal assessment in greater depth, but this is a topic which will be very helpful to you.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:49.920]  And the last topic in theme A is machine learning, which will be beneficial to you in terms of knowing about the latest trends in the field of technology.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:06:02.920]  And it will also be good topic for the students who are willing to do the extended essay in computer science, because we see that many students choose machine learning as one of the topics for their e.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:07.920]  So if you're planning to do e in computer science, then I would say that keep a close eye on machine learning topic.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:13.920]  So these are four topics from the from the theme A point of view.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:18.920]  Now these four topics will be tested as a part of paper one.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.920]  Now in paper one, there is also one more thing that is the case study.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.920]  So if you look at paper one, which will share with you some sample papers.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:43.920]  This paper one is divided into two different parts. One is section A. So section A will contain that these four topics and section B will be based on a case study, which will be released one year before your final examinations.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:52.920]  It will be based on some technological development or technological field. For example, it can be based on autonomous technologies.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:07:02.920]  It can based on cryptocurrency. It can be based on robotics. So any of the latest trends in technology, I becomes up with a case study every year.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:08.920]  So for your assessments, it will be released on time in the month of August next year.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:15.920]  And then you will be doing some personal research on that topic and that will cover your section B of paper one.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.920]  So just to summarize paper one will have two parts.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:26.920]  Section A, which will be based on a one a two a three and a four and section B will be based on case study.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:33.920]  So that completes our paper one topics theme B, as I said is about programming.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:45.920]  So you can see it starts with computational thinking B1 B2 is programming and you can see the highest number of hours is allocated for programming because that's the thing which requires a lot of practice.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:58.920]  So that's why we have 40 and 42 hours allocated for programming and I can tell you honestly that these hours are just nothing in front of what actually you need to spend you need to spend much more hours than what's indicated here.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:09.920]  This is the actual classroom teaching time, but you have to spend many more hours to get proficient with the programming B3 is object oriented programming, which is just an extension of B2.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:21.920]  Which is more for HL as compared to SL so you can see HL has 23 hours and SL has just seven hours so the content for SL is very little HL is more.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:32.920]  Then we have B4 which is only for HL SL doesn't have abstract data structures or abstract data types, but SL have HL have that in good length.
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.920]  And then I say as I said case study for SL 15 hours and for HL 30 hours.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:44.920]  Now the computational solution is basically the internal assessment which you will be working on.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:56.920]  We will talk more about this, but I in computer science is essentially a solution being developed using the programming.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:06.920]  So you are developing some computational solution with showcasing your understanding of the coding that is what computational solution is all about.
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:16.920]  And then there is a collaborative science project which will be a collaborative collaboration between all science subjects physics chemistry biology, ESS and computer science.
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.920]  So you will be working on some common objective which will be in year two.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:27.920]  So that makes it total hours for 150 for SL and 244 HL.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.920]  So we just talked about that theme A and theme B.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:53.920]  This is a table which shows them just the main topics which is talked about computer fundamentals network databases machine learning and in HL in theme B we have the topics covered for computer thinking paper one we will have a separate session for this, but as of now you should just know that paper one is based on just for.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:10:11.920]  Themes in themes or in just for topics in theme a case study I just told you that it will be a pre released material which will be released in the month of August next year, which will be based on some recent technological trends and then you will have section B with some questions based on those case study.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:31.920]  It's relatively an easier part of paper one because you will already have the case study which will be about two to three a four pages of text and you will do some research on that and based on that there will be questions in the exam paper two computational thinking where you will have the questions related to programming in the theoretical form.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:47.920]  For example, what is object oriented programming, what is a class, what is an object, what is inheritance, what is construct so those kind of theoretical questions, but based on programming plus the coding that will be tested in paper two.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:11:16.920]  Two external papers and one internal assessment paper one and I so these are the three parts which will be assessed for your paper one paper two and I the weightage is paper one 35% paper to 35% and internal assessment is 30% that is for SL so SL although there is no difference in the quality of internal assessment or the solution that you are developing.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:32.920]  The quality should be I mean quality is same for SL and HL in fact the examiner will not even know whether the work being submitted is of SL student or HL student so that mean the complexity needs to be same between the two.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:42.920]  The only difference comes is in that overall weightage so for SL the IA weightage is 30% whereas for HL it is 20%.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:57.920]  So paper one 35 paper to 35 and internal assessment is 30% whereas it is of HL it is paper one 40% paper to 40% and IA is 20%.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:07.920]  This is about HL more depth and time in external assessments than SL IA is the same project as SL but weightage is 20%.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:14.920]  That is what I told you for HL 40% 40% and 20%.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:23.920]  So internal assessment we are not looking right now it is just a solution which you need to develop and we will be starting IA's little early so that you can finish them in time.
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:36.920]  Most likely we will introduce the IA's to you in the month of January after the December break so that you can start a little early to be able to finish it in time.
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:49.920]  But we will be talking about IA in more depth so I am not going into these slides right now because it is a full session in itself and we don't want to overburden you with all these information.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.920]  So that is about the presentation.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:03.920]  So we are trying to keep it light as of now we don't want to make it too complicated because we know that you know it will take a lot of time for you to understand the curriculum structure.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:17.920]  So as long as you have understood what all is going to be assessed as a part of your paper one paper to I think that would be a good understanding for you at this stage.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.920]  Okay Martin you want to add anything before we ask students to ask any questions that they may have.
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:33.920]  No I think just wanted to say that is important for us to be familiar with the structure and what is expected to us throughout the course.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:40.920]  So as again as I mentioned earlier to be proactive and plan according to all that we is required for the course.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:53.920]  Thank you yeah absolutely yeah absolutely okay so we'll give you a little time to ask your question but let me quickly take you through the canvas platform although it's new for us as well and we'll be learning along with you.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:09.920]  But from whatever we have understood so far I think it's worth showing you different sections so that you don't struggle much now my screen and Martin screen will be slightly different than your screen because we are teachers and we have lot more options here.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.920]  But the sections which are common between us I just want to show you.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:32.920]  Okay so essentially you should be able to see all these options like home announcements units assignments, discussion and feedback will not be available to you probably I don't know because this is something which we will give you the feedback but obviously you will have to see the feedback so probably you may also have feedback.
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:40.920]  Online classroom nine online classroom we have three different classes one is the main class.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:15:00.920]  This is what we are using right now so any lesson created under main class will be visible to both HL sections not to SL but both HL sections and the other two will be when I or Martin will be meeting you as a class individually not as a combined.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:20.920]  But I don't see much chances of that because all our classes will be combined so I don't think we'll be using this ever but when Martin is meeting you one by one to one or I'm meeting my class one to one then probably will create it under our class but all the weekend classes would be created under the main class.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:38.920]  So it will be available here that's our online class now the list of units can be seen here so if you go to the units you can see all the units for week one until the end of the semester is available although the platform is still getting developed.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:47.920]  So these weeks may still be empty some of these weeks may be empty if I go here I'm sure there will be no content yeah you can see this is just a template.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:16:15.920]  But we have completed the course authoring for semester one so until December everything is ready but I'm not sure as a student if you can go to the next weeks until you are in that particular week but anyway even if you can't go that's perfectly fine because it should be focusing more on the current week so when you go to the unit which option we are in if you go to the.
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:44.920]  Which option we were in units here units when we are in units and if you go to unit one so getting started so when you click on this link it will show you couple of tabs and each tab will have their individual content now what is important for you to do is after you have read this part then instead of jumping to lesson one next tab go next within the same time because we are still under introduction and there's.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:52.920]  What to be covered within the introduction so if you go to the next it will take you to the next time.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:17:10.920]  Is it that way or no now let me let me yeah show you the next step at the top of the lesson so you need to go if you're introduction then you click on the lesson because if you click on next it will take you to the following section so.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:39.920]  The discussion of 1.2 oh yeah got it got it got it thanks Martin for clarifying that I think you have you have explored the platform already a little bit yeah yeah okay so yeah thanks for that so after having read about introduction so everything related to introduction will be available on this page and then when you go to the lesson everything related to the lesson would be here and then you have these further expansions like discussions in box so this is more.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:49.920]  So this is more about canvas as how to use canvas as a platform then we have the practice so there's a video which you can play on your browser.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:18:08.920]  I will learn a profile can be downloaded from here so anything which is available for download will be shared as a link which when you click will be downloaded to your computer these are the I will learn a profiles and then you have a quiz for that particular section and once you have done all this.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:31.920]  1.1 how do they go to 1.2 then so then then you get heads at the bottom okay or you can go back to the units yeah exactly so I went back to the units does the easiest way to do and then you go to 1.2 and when you click on 1.2 it will show you the content for 1.2 so now we are on 1.2.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:19:00.920]  Frequently ask questions and all that right so this is how you have to cover each and every tab for the lesson and this platform records your access records that if you have gone to the lessons it will mark you as completed for that particular tab right and it also records how much time you have spent so that is some sort of monitoring reports for us to know which all modules you have covered which are yet not covered.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:30.920]  So there is something called engagement rating which we give to the students after every term and while giving the engagement rating which is like engaged one category is engaged second category is in sufficiently engaged and the last category is not engaged so it's serious if somebody is not engaged or even in sufficiently engaged because you have chosen a course which is self based but at the same time it requires a lot of commitment.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:41.920]  So I think if you started on the weekly basis inventory to 35 minutes each day I think that will be that will contribute to put engagement from your end.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:56.920]  So this is about units so after having completed all then there will be some assignments each week for example during this week you have a discussion assignment about I will earn a profile.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:22.920]  So week one has I will earn a profile similarly week two has something else now see this is about theme a 1.1 CPU GPU which is from the topic computer fundamentals and week the next discussion is in week six then week seven so every week you will have certain assignments not necessarily the discussion will be there in every week but you have to keep an eye on which weeks have the discussion forum.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:39.920]  Now within the discussion forum we can see that there is already a lot of discussion about the learner profile so you can see here and you will also be able to see everybody's post and that is for a simple reason that discussion needs to be collaborative.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:51.920]  So if you have read somebody's post first you have to post make your own reflection you have to contribute and then you have to reply to minimum two other participants and that reply should not be very brief.
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:21:06.920]  You have to add little more to what they have already said and possibly you can ask some follow up question and we as teachers will also keep an eye on the discussion and we will be taking part in that from time to time.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:17.920]  Like for example I like your reflection ideas online will you draw notes in a journal or type them in digital digitally after lessons.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:28.920]  So we will add some follow up questions so if you come back to this probably you can just reply to any of the comments made by your teacher.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:49.920]  Okay so that's about discussion feedback is the section where we will be providing you with the feedback so all the assignments which you will submit will require feedback from the teacher unless you have done that you will be able to see that report on your own dashboard we can see all the students here but you will be able to see just yourself.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:22:18.920]  Online classroom we talked about people is the section where you see the list of all the students I don't know if you have this report but we have this added to our tab where we can see every student's details and if you want to get in touch with somebody we have the emails over here and different all other information resources is the section where we will be uploading from time to time documents for example if you have created some presentation for example.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:47.920]  So I can show you so for example as I said that we have a week will be doing the online lessons so we have started working on the presentation so this is one of them so we will put this copy of presentation in the in that folder which will be accessible to you.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:23:06.920]  So you will have your content plus you will come these presentations and finally you're recording for all the sessions so they will be very helpful to you when you're doing your personal revision or you want to go through the content again after the teacher has covered so all that will be available in this resources pages.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:35.920]  Another thing is about getting in touch with the teacher so how do you contact the teacher for that you have to go to the inbox and then you have to go to compose and see for us it is showing different options because we have to select which course we want to send a message to but for you I think it will be slightly different and you'll be able to select your teacher within this drop down list.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:54.920]  So if ever you have to write to us we discourage use of emails in fact I will never reply if you email me directly but if you write it over here we will be replying back to you so please use this as a mode of communication between yourself and for us as teachers.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:06.920]  That's about in box then there is this calendar which I was talking about what can you remember where the calendar is.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:18.920]  Yeah give me one second I think is that it's right there on the courses on the left navigation panel.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:38.920]  Yeah yeah yeah on the left yeah so if you go to the calendar this will give you a summary of everything that is being covered during each week any of the deadlines that are coming or any of the submissions to be made all will be here in one place so for example on 17th of this month you have couple of things deal.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:54.920]  So you can easily see in one place as to what are the things to be done there's a discussion and there is a academic integrity contract form right and why it's coming many times but it's only one submission from each one of you.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:07.920]  Okay so essentially there are only two submissions one is discussion forum about the learner profile and one is the academic integrity policy now in the next week you will have a quiz.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:27.920]  On the CPU components so there will be a quiz embedded into the system which you will take and you will be auto graded out of 10 marks so that is one assignment then you have apart from that no you don't have anything else it's just the weekly quiz that you have next week.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:39.920]  Week after next we have another quiz so this is one place where you can see all your assignments in one place but that will also be visible under the assignments tab.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:56.920]  So if you go to the assignments tab this will also show you different assignments which are embedded into the system week after week for example in week one we have two assignments the other profile plus academic integrity week two we have coins on CPU components.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:22.920]  And week three we have another quiz week four we have quiz on data representation and we have numbers conversions so you will you will have some assignments to convert the numbers from one form to another so this is how you can see in one place different assignments but you don't really have to worry about the corresponding weeks you should just be particular about the current week which is running.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:42.920]  At any point if you think that your school schedule is not giving you enough time to complete the assignments during a certain week please inform your teacher well in advance that we have sports day coming up and I'll be busy so I will not be able to finish my assignments in time for that week number four.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:57.920]  So if you inform us beforehand that will be better rather than not submitting anything and then when the report goes to your school then you come back and say that oh I was busy so use an active way of informing rather than a passive way that will be good on your part.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:08.920]  So that is all about the platform and I'm sure that you will get more familiar as you continue to use it week after week.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.920]  That's all from my end.
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:25.920]  Now it's over to you please ask any questions that you may have about the course about the timeline about the platform anything that you wish to ask please unmute yourself and ask any questions.
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.920]  Come on okay, sugar please ask your question.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:41.920]  Yeah, can you please tell us what will impact the ID predicted grades for promotion?
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:52.920]  Yeah, that's a good question and actually it's too early to talk about predicted grades but then it's your continuous profile that leads to a certain grade.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:02.920]  So the first set of grades that you will get as a predicted is in the month of December after the end of semester which will largely be based on IP grade.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:20.920]  Discriptors IP has a great descriptors for level seven six five four three two one and based on the outcome of your assessment during the semester based on your contributions to the discussion based on the way you have shown your engagement.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:30.920]  The teachers will make a professional judgment in alignment with ID great descriptors to decide which grade you are actually getting into.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:50.920]  Now I'm sure that the quizzes will let you score seven on seven all the small assignments will show that you have scored seven so there may be too many sevens reflected on your grade book but that necessarily that doesn't necessarily give a clear indication that you will be on seven point scale.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:29:12.920]  So these predicted grades would be mainly based on written assessments which will be like end of semester exam the practice tests the coding assignments which are which are detailed work submission from your end that is what will contribute more than those small assignments such as quizzes etc.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:26.920]  So I mean just to simplify predicted grade would be based on the IB descriptors for different grade boundaries and how well you have performed in the summative assessments as well as the semester exam.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920]  Does that answer your question.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.920]  Yes, thank you.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.920]  All right.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:46.920]  Okay, any other question about the curriculum or anything else please feel free to ask this is an opportunity for you to know more about the subject.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.920]  Hello.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.920]  Yeah.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:30:10.920]  Yeah, I was just wondering if the engagement system you guys had is summative or this is like failed averages so let's say I practice two hours just eat in three days throughout the week with that award me.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:12.920]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.920]  So add half an hour.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:15.920]  Yeah.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.920]  Yeah.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:26.920]  So more than more than our honestly it will be more about your coverage of content and also how timely you have submitted all your assignments.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:36.920]  If your submissions of assignments are happening within the deadline, then it is very highly likely that you will be given the engagement reading as fully engaged.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:39.920]  Yes, Alma.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:52.920]  I was wondering how like how long should we open Pajama per week, like how long do you think is a good amount.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.920]  I mean, see, I wish there was a direct answer to this.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:05.920]  I mean, it will largely depend on how much time would you take in order to cover the entire content.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:12.920]  Like if I ask you how much time would you spend on mathematics every week, will you have a fixed answer for that.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:20.920]  Alma, if I ask you how many hours will you spend every day on math.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.920]  Yeah, there is not like direct answer, but like approximately how much do you think?
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:33.920]  So see, as I said that it will largely depend on how much time you take to understand.
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.920]  For example, if you are within you to programming, when I said you doesn't mean you, I mean anybody.
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:47.920]  If somebody is within you to programming, probably they may have to spend two to three hours initial in the initial phase when they are learning the programming concepts.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:52.920]  But if you already have done programming, then probably half an hour a day is more than enough.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:57.920]  So it will depend on what topic you are learning and how much time do you think you need to cover that topic.
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:59.920]  So it will vary from once to into another.
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:07.920]  But my only point is that rather than the time limit, it would be good if you say that, have I spent about 45 minutes on my CS?
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:13.920]  Because if it was in your school, you would have got 45 to 50 minute lesson every day.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.920]  So we would expect that since you don't have a direct lesson in your classroom.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:22.920]  So if you spend that 45 to 50 minutes every day, that will be good for you.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:26.920]  I mean, that will be enough to cover the computer science curriculum.
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.920]  Okay. Okay. Thank you.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:29.920]  Yeah.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:35.920]  Okay. Thanks for those questions. Anyone else with any other question?
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.920]  It's an opportunity for you to ask.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.920]  Go ahead Thomas.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920]  Thomas.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.920]  Yeah.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.920]  I think I forgot it.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:46.920]  It was.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:47.920]  Yeah. Okay.
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:57.920]  So after this meeting is over, what would you kind of recommend with and they are prepared?
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:32:58.920]  Okay.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:03.920]  So our next meeting will be held on next Saturday or Sunday.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.920]  We'll confirm that to you.
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:09.920]  So this week was very light because we didn't give you any reading assignments for week one.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.920]  It was just about learner profile and academic integrity policy.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:23.920]  But for the for the next week, you will have introduction to the computer fundamentals, which includes theoretical topics such as CPU GPU and all that.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:31.920]  So what I would recommend is can you check and let me know if you only have the access to week to content.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:37.920]  Because as a student, I'm not sure if you are given access beforehand or it's only during the running week.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:46.920]  Could you check once unit one of you and tell me if you have access to week to content?
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:53.920]  Can you see this computer fundamentals?
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:54.920]  It must be.
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:55.920]  Yeah.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:56.920]  Okay.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.920]  Okay. So if it works for you, it will work for everybody else.
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:06.920]  So what I would suggest is that you can go to 2.1 and start reading about this topic.
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:12.920]  It's a very interesting topic because it will let you know what all components are there within the computer system.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.920]  And it's a little technical topic.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:19.920]  You know where you have to learn some of the concepts.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.920]  There are definitions.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.920]  There is conceptual understanding.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.920]  So I would say that you can start learning.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.920]  It's quite a lengthy chapter.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:29.920]  There are a lot of things which haven't covered in this.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.920]  So try to learn this.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:31.920]  That would be enough.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.920]  And then next Saturday or Sunday when we meet.
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.920]  We will discuss this topic through the presentation, which I just shared.
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:45.920]  As soon as the presentation is complete, we will share that with you in the folder so that you will have this beforehand.
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.920]  And you can prepare.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.920]  You can go through the slides and then we will discuss it during the classroom.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.920]  That will be helpful.
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:35:00.920]  Rather than you having an access to this on the spot, it will be good if we can share this with you beforehand so that you will know what we are going to study.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:07.920]  But the content part is definitely more detailed in the lessons that we have developed.
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.920]  So my recommendation is go through this content.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:16.920]  And prepare on notes that's always beneficial.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.920]  Okay.
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.920]  Okay, Thomas is done.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.920]  Who else who is the next question?
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.920]  I have a question.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.920]  What are like the resources to other artists?
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.920]  Only the Pomodra curses or.
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.920]  Okay, that's that's a that's a very good question.
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.920]  So see.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.920]  I mean, there could be a lot of external resources.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.920]  But what I would recommend is.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.920]  If you can buy a textbook, we will share the details with you.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:55.920]  So there are officially two textbooks, which are endorsed by the IB.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:01.920]  One is published by Oxford University Press OUP.
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.920]  And one is published by order publication.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.920]  So we will share the names of both the books.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.920]  But honestly, I've seen both and I find order to be very good.
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:15.920]  So it used to be called order, but now it's mutton.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.920]  Do you know what it is called now?
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.920]  Order publication is some H a publication or something.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.920]  Yeah, it's actually.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.920]  Yes, yes, I have it actually here.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.920]  Okay, you have that book.
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.920]  Can you show? Yeah, perfect. Yeah.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:35.920]  So, so this is, I think I think your virtual background is.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.920]  I think it is.
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.920]  So they can.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.920]  So this is a very good textbook as an additional resource.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.920]  And if you can buy this, see, we are not promoting the book.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:50.920]  But since you asked about a base, this will be the book.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.920]  Can you see that?
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.920]  And yes, he's by hatchet.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.920]  Yeah, this is by hatchet. Right.
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:02.920]  So this will be a very good book because this has every topic covered in a very systematic way.
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:05.920]  Topic after topic, which is also there on the parmoja.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:11.920]  But then having text book is always beneficial because it has a lot of exercises and it has a lot of.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:15.920]  End of chapter questions and everything is covered in a very systematic way.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.920]  And you don't really have to do the screen time all the time.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:22.920]  So if you go to the book, you will develop the habit of reading the book.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:30.920]  So we will share with you the ISBN number and the exact name of the book so that you can you can ask your school to procure one for you.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:37.920]  But having said that, it is just optional as an added resource.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.920]  Otherwise, parmoja content is also quite well developed.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.920]  And that can be enough for you to score high marks and you write the exams.
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:51.920]  But that was a good question. Thanks for asking.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.920]  Anyone else?
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:59.920]  Valeria.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:03.920]  In any case, I'm not able to attend the meeting with the meetings.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.920]  We like to be recorded. Yes.
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:14.920]  Yes, all the meetings will be recorded and it will be put into see there are two ways to access them are recording.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.920]  If you're part of HL group, then if you go to the main class.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:26.920]  Under the online classroom, you will be able to access it from there, but to make it easier.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920]  And accessible to all students.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:38.920]  We are thinking about creating a folder and put all the recordings there in a very systematic way so that it doesn't take you much time to locate the recordings.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:48.920]  So not only that it will be available on canvas platform, but it will also be available on SharePoint folder whose accessibility will be given to each one of you.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.920]  But then having said that, I would really recommend that if you attend it online.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:02.920]  When it is happening, that will have its own advantage because we honestly don't generally go back and look at the recording for the sessions which are already done.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:08.920]  I mean, that's something I mean, it's it's not good, but it does happen.
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.920]  So if you can attend online, that is always beneficial.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.920]  And also there might you might have a question that is not answered during the recording.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.920]  So that's what the advantage is, you know, and yeah.
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.920]  And as we said that these sessions are more about interactions.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:30.920]  So it will be good if you can attend and talk to each other about the topics clarity.
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:35.920]  Yeah, because my time zone is kind of weird, so that's why.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.920]  What's your what's your time?
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.920]  I'm in Saudi Arabia, so right now it's like 5.30.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.920]  5.30 evening.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.920]  Yeah, but I usually like to stay after school.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:51.920]  So I will be arriving home at like seven. So that's why.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.920]  So you have school on Saturdays?
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:02.920]  No, we have school from Sunday to Thursday, but I usually have activities on Saturday as well.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:07.920]  So we will have the lessons only on either on Saturday or Sunday.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:12.920]  We will never have them on the weekdays.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.920]  And we'll take your choice as to what would be the best time because we thought 1 p.m.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:22.920]  GMT will be accessible to everyone starting from US all the way to Japan.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.920]  So we thought 1 p.m. GMT would be good.
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:33.920]  But if you have other priorities as a larger group, we are open to discussing that.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:37.920]  But yes, the recording will be available for you.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.920]  Any other question?
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:49.920]  Yeah, in the chat, since the name of a course, but I have will this course, but by Oxford for persons.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.920]  2027 work.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:55.920]  Yeah, yeah, that's also a good book. Yeah, it's it's a good book.
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:00.920]  I mean, see anything which is coming from OUP or HACHA publication.
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.920]  That is fully endorsed by IB.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.920]  So you can definitely trust the authenticity and credibility of the book.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:19.920]  So you can buy data as well.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:26.920]  Any other questions, Swathi, you have been quite.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920]  Do you have any questions, Swathi?
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.920]  I don't.
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.920]  Thank you.
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.920]  All right, then, is there anybody who could not mark their attendance?
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:46.920]  Everybody is smart.
