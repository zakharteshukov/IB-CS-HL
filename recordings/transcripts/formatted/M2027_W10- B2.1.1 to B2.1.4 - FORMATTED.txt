CLASS INTRODUCTION & ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS
================================================================================

That's okay Thomas. Thank you. Thank you for letting me know what you're doing. That's okay Thomas. Thank you. Thank you for letting me know. Give me one second here. I prepare all the top comments. We're going to be using the top comment we're going to be using.

All right. So once again, good morning everybody. We are all rash. He's going to be able to join. It looks like he's going to be with us. Initially, the plan was that I was going to go as I was going to be with you guys.


================================================================================
IA PROPOSALS DISCUSSION
================================================================================

He is traveling, so he might have some issues connecting. So I'm going to give him a few minutes or seconds and see if he's able to join. And if he's not, then I'll start the class. I haven't had a chance yet to look at the proposals for the IA, but I just before we start, I just want to see how that process of writing your idea, your proposal went. I just look over

really quick, but I haven't had the chance to really read in detail what you have in mind. Anybody wants to share the idea that you have for your internal assessment? Any volunteers?

Namo, go ahead. So currently, my hobby is playing chess on the site chess.com. Okay. And I'm managing a club there. So one of my tasks is to update a forum where I record

the points of each member accumulated from arenas. And I manually by searching all the pages. So the event pages. And now I want to automate it because it's time consuming and has can have some errors. Okay, cool. That involves managing a little bit of a database. So are you going to try to

do this kind of a standalone app or just with environment? Probably it will be a Chrome extension. Okay. Okay, cool. All right. Nice. Interesting. Anybody else want to share your idea? crucial. Go ahead. Oh, me? Yes. Yes. I might mispronounce some of your names, but it's not in

because I just know the no better. Go ahead. Yeah. So my idea is like, I'm a designer. So I make rings and stuff. And the kids like a ring I made. And like, I'm going to my idea for my IA is to make a add-on for Brenda, which is like a 3D modern software where some but where people can input like an image of like a vector image of their of a shape. And then they can input a ring size. And then the add-on can automatically turn that

vector for image into the a 3D ring ready for 3D printing. And it's all like smoothed out and everything. And it could be instantly printed off. So you can like test a bunch of you can make a bunch of rings take refast automated. Because right now I found that like it was really difficult

to make my personal ring with this with in 3D because it's right now making rings takes a lot of time both digitally and physically. So automating the entire process of making a ring thought I was I thought was an interesting idea. Okay. Yeah. So you're going to combine I mean looking at it,

you're going to combine a little bit of your graphic design with the computer science that you're learning. That's pretty cool. Okay. Because it's going to have for both of you it's going to have a lot of personal engagement. Right. So which is it's an important part of your internal assessment.

All right. Anybody else just one more. Remember that the link for the attendance is on the chat if you just joined. So make sure that just go and check the attendance. Anybody else has wants to share with us what you are your proposal for your internal assessment.

Alexandra, go ahead. So my project is about designing a system to help a necessary doctors manage patient desire. So it's that they can be able to access patient files easily and then edit their documents

instead of with being stored like on files people files. Okay. Yes. All right. Pretty good. Again, I have to me and and Rajesh, we need to meet and start looking at your proposals and just go through the process of approving or not, you know most most of the time the ideas are Aisa, go ahead and then I'll continue in a second. Aisa?

Yes, sir. Hi. I just wanted to ask how we're going to measure our grades because we didn't do a midterm exam or anything to give a grade for. So what we do and when I said we is is Pamoia, what we do is we report to your sites. Right. And in your sites, they coordinate those

things. We, this is my first year working with Pamoia. So I don't have a clear picture of how they actually do it. Right. I think that will be a question that Raj should answer because he's the coordinator and I really don't have an exact answer for that. I know what I just said that we do

pass information into your site and the assessment that we need like monitoring and that somebody needs to be with you guys are just coordinated in your home school. But I really don't know or don't have an answer to your question. So that would be something I

have to to ask myself. Okay. That's okay. Sorry. Thank you so much. No, thank you. All right. Anybody else? Okay. I think we, if you guys don't have any questions, any more questions or just make sure that you take attendance and we are, we're ready to start. Okay. So let me share

my screen. Alma, do you have a question? Yes. For this week's like assignments, I know we were like supposed to download like Java. But for me, I couldn't figure it out. So I didn't end up downloading it. So I wanted to ask if you can just quickly help with that. Okay. Let's stay then

at the end of the meeting and then I'll try to see how can I help you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. You're welcome. All right. So let me share my screen. Let me set this up for us. All right. So today we are basically going over some basic information about

programming and Java in a specific, right? So let me, let me try to do it. One second. One second because this, I opened the file on a different, and it just

doesn't want to see it. Give me a minute. Please. I just lost the document. Okay.

All right. Looks like I found it. Give me one second. Instead, the document is not opening on a tap. It's opening as an individual document, and it doesn't give me the option to actually show it.

Where is this? Give me one minute. You see the document now. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. Awesome. Give me a second here. All right. So these are the topics for our class today. So we go into a little bit of what is needed for us


================================================================================
B2.1.1 - VARIABLES & DATA TYPES
================================================================================

to create our progress in Java, what the IB requires. Okay. So here we're going to see the definitions of local variables and the different data types that are used in Java, which are the same data types that we see in other languages. So if you are familiar with Python or C or C++,


================================================================================
B2.1.2 - LOCAL VARIABLES & SCOPE
================================================================================

those are basically a standard data types that we see. Right. Now we're going to look at local variables in Java, a field, and when we're able to share variables through different methods on our program and how to trace the state of a variable as we move through our program in Java.


================================================================================
B2.1.3 - STRING MANIPULATION
================================================================================

Right. And then we're going to look at constructing programs that extract and manipulate strings or substrings how to look into the index position or a particular character in a string, extracting substrings, finding positions on of a particular character that we might be looking for in a string, and a common task that you are probably assessed on during the IB is extract domain name from a running email or extract a particular substring of a given string. And how to manipulate substring replace


================================================================================
B2.1.4 - EXCEPTION HANDLING
================================================================================

part of a string, concatenate, etc. And then this is a very a section that I find really interesting because a lot of you probably are going to work with databases or are going to reach some kind of file. So we need to learn how to manage exceptions, especially when we are reading files.

Obviously there are other exceptions that can happen, especially when there are in unexpected inputs from either a resource or from the users. Okay. And how to avoid, not necessarily avoid, but how to manage logic errors if there are logic errors in our code. Okay. And then we're going


================================================================================
DEBUGGING TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

to look at some debugging techniques that we use to revise our code. And then at the end, there are some questions that I intend to ask you a couple of those so we can have a practice. Okay. Can I have some practice? Okay. All right. So let's start. All right. So in Java,

so a variable is just a placeholder, right? A placeholder to a store's own some value. That what a variable is. The definition here is like a name box in the sense that we do when we declare a variable as a part of memory is selected to hold that particular value and the size of that depends on the type of variable that we are defining. Here are some examples.

When we define a variable in Java, we variables in Java are static, which means that we have to define a type. And that type stays with the variable throughout the whole program. So we can not change the data that that particular variable stores, right? So it has, it requires a type,

which in this case will be the integer, a name for the variable and then a value. For those of you that are new to coding, the equal sign is the assignment operator. And assignments in Java, we always read them from from right to left. Okay. So these are the clear as a variable name age,

whose value is going to be 16, which is an integer. So in Java, for us to store a decimal numbers, we can use a double or float, but most of the time for what the applications that we are going to develop in this course, we're going to use a double variables. Okay.

Float variables will be used if we need like a bigger precision. And for that is like flow variables have between 15 to 16 decimal places for precision while doubles have between seven and eight, but that's probably more than enough for what we will be doing. The other type of

variable is a chart character variable. Characters are defined in Java between single quotes. And Boolean variables, those are variables that take either a true or false value. And then a string, a string is just a collection of characters in double quotes. And that's what a string is. Okay.

As I mentioned earlier, Java is a statistical type. We have to declare and that type is fixed throughout the life of the through the program. Okay. Now I be required you guys to focus on these types of variable, right? Boolean character integer string decimal. All right. Obviously,

they're going to be some data types that we might need, especially depending on the type of internal assessment that you might end up developing. All right. So here we have a a small piece of code. A Boolean variable is logged in is the clear and is set to false.

So this if statement is going to check if it's login the state of that variable if it's false or true. And then if it is true, so if the person is logged in, then it's going to present to the screen this test. Welcome back. And if it's not, then it's going to say,

please login, right? So that will be an use of that particular variable. So most of the use of Boolean variables is in conditional statements. And conditional statements in this case, most of them are if statements, right? All right. So characters, these are different types of characters.

Variables that we can define, letters, digits, symbols, all we need is just then in a single quote, okay? In reality, the way Java actually stores the character is actually stored in a medical code that represents that character. Remember when we discuss about data representation,

the ASCII code, the Unicode. So that code will be the one that actually says store, all right? So integers, positive or negative integers, and most of the time we use them for counting, for indexing arrays, for loops, things of that nature. And then decimal, which is double,

right? And decimal for IB in level program. So again, as I said earlier, I don't think we will have the need to use float type variables. But the case, my arrive that we do. And in that case, well, we'll just use that. All right. So decimal values are useful fractions, like average distance

at percent. And then we have a string, which is just a collection of characters of sequence of characters. These are two examples of them. And one particular difference between the previous type of variables and the string is that the string is actually an object in Java. And also,

there are going to be some methods that are going to be associated with that, okay? All right. So local variables, local variables are either the clear, inside a method, a constructor of a blog, like for example, on an if, or a loop. So when we start a loop like four, and four in I equal

to zero, so on, that I on that for loop becomes a local variable, and always going to exist during the execution of that particular for loop or the blog, okay? So it's called local, because they only access bit within the method or the blog that is running, right? So that is this scope. The scope

of the variable is where the variable actually is alive. And after that execution of the blog, the variable stops existing, which means that it's not the longer of kind any memory. Okay? So here we have a small example. So we have this method. And for those of you that are

new to Java, then this is what we call the signature of the method, right? And then we have methods are similar to functions in Python in the sense that you have a beginning and at n. In this case, this is the name of the variable message. It's been initialized to this string.

So it's local because it's in within this method. So here we have the main method that is trying to that is calling this particular method, right? So notice the variable message was defined locally inside these brackets, right? From here to there. That's

where this variable message exists. When we go into the main method, which is this, there is no problem calling the method and the method what is going to do is going to or the compiler is going to do is going to go to where the instructions of that method is and execute the statements.

The variable message leaves there. So this is completely valid. However, when we go to outside that method, like here, right now that's a comment, right? But if we were to compile and run this a small program, then this will give us an error. And the error will be running time error because

there is no logic error in what is written here only that we are not using the variable message in the correct scope. So that will create a runtime error when we run the program. So message is local to grid. It is created when grid is called and this appears when it's finished. So that's


================================================================================
PRACTICE QUESTIONS & EXERCISES
================================================================================

why calling it here will create a compile runtime error. All right. So here we have, is there any particular question up to this point? Anybody? We're good? All right. So if we are less, let's keep working on this. All right. So feels and share variables. A question? Yes. Go ahead.


================================================================================
CLASS CONCLUSION
================================================================================

So it needs a compile timer, not runtime error. Right. It's when you compile. You just mentioned. Right. Right. I'm sorry. Yes. It's compile. Well, it won't compile. The program won't compile, right? Because it's going to say, right, in order on time error. Thank you

for clarifying that. That is correct. It's not going to compile because the scope of the variable is not the correct one. Yeah. All right. So feels and share variables in Java. So one characteristic of Java is that we really don't have global variables. But I guess there is

a workaround for that. And is if that you declare a variable at the class level. Okay. So for example, if you look at this piece of code, here is the signature of the class. And here we are declaring a variable that is, it doesn't belong to any particular method.

Not the main, no, any other method. Right. That variable count that is declared as a static is going to be accessible to all the methods in the class. All right. So in that sense, that becomes a global variable. All right. Because has access or this scope of the variable is

any, any part of the class because right now is being declared as a class variable. Right. So it's accessible for all the methods in the class. So this variable count will be changed if we call the method increment. That will change the value of the variable count. So notice

count is not defined inside increment. So it's not a local variable is actually, in this case, a global one, right. Or it's acting as a global bar. Right. So here we have kind of the whole program. So in the main method, we call increment twice. So since the variable count is a field

variable. So the first time we call increment is just going to increment the value by one. And then here, it will be incremented by one also. Now notice that count to print the value of count is actually called in the main outside the two inside outside. I'm sorry, the method.

But since it's a field that is accepted everywhere, then this won't be an issue. Right. Then it can be there. Now, so note for us as programmers, even though that's feasible to do is in reality, not a really good practice to do to have a bunch of global variables because it's going to be at some point cumbersome to actually be able to follow the program. Okay. So can you have some?

Yes, of course, you can have some. Right. And the nature of the task that you're going to do, the nature of the problem, you're developing probably are going to require one or two global variables. But we don't want too many of them. It's going to cost probably a lot of methods,

problems later on to follow the state of that variable. Since it's chair and can be changed for different methods. Okay. All right. So something that you are going to be for sure as during your assessment is tracing a piece of code somehow. Right. So let's consider this code.

Give me one second. I have prepared another document where you can see the whole. You can see the whole document together. All right. So give me one second. Let me see if I'm able to to actually do that. So let me stop chairing this document and then I'll change to another.

Give me one second and I'll share something else. This one. Okay. All right. Here here it is. So here is the whole document. So this is what I would like you to do. Tracing a document is keeping track of the values of the different variables.

Right. So in this case, we want to see what the output will be. So in this particular case, we have a static variable total that is going to be a share field because it's at the level of the scope is the whole class. Right. And then inside this update, we also have a local variable

whole value. And then total, which is the scope is the whole class, then total is updated inside this. Right. And then this particular method update is called twice during the domain method. All right. So go ahead and try it on your own to trace this particular program. And I will

like for you guys to type the answer that you believe on the chat. Just wait a second. Hold it in your mind for a second so we can give the chance to other people to kind of trace this particular program. Okay.

And then in a second, in a minute, I'll tell you or we can just look at it. Okay. So when you're ready, go ahead and type your answer but on a private chat to me because I don't want anybody to see the actual value. Right. I want to see what you guys get on your own.

Okay. So on a private chat to me answer what will be the output of this program. All right. That's fine. We're know you're good. Good, good. All right.

I'm waiting. Sophia, you're good. No, you're correct. Jason, go try one more time. Go back and try one more time. Okay. Marco, you're good. Oh, um, value, value implies what is past. I'll explain that in detail. So value is what is past

to the update method. So for example, when we call update the first time with a three, right. So this value gets the value three. So on the first call, this line is three times two because the value that is past the argument that is given was three. Okay.

So let's see. Alma, yes, that's, that's, that's correct. Jason, try to take a look again. Marco, we're good. Ricardo, yes. Thomas, correct. Tyler, correct.

All right. Pretty good. Julia, yes. That is correct. All right. So, um, almost, uh, everybody, just a couple of you, I would like Jason to give it a, uh, one more try. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah. See that take your time. We're, we're not in a hurry. Okay. This is a skill that, uh, is very, very, uh, common to be assessed during, um, attest. Okay. And this is just, uh, one example.

All right. So I'm going to pick on, on somebody to actually explain it instead of me. Okay. So who wants to volunteer to, um, to explain it? All right. There are people, uh, raise their hand, give me a second. Okay.

Uh, all right. So Marco, go ahead. Okay. Go ahead and explain. So, how do we trade this program? Marco, we, uh, I cannot hear you. I don't know. Yes. Now I can hear you. Yes. Yeah. So, um,

we have that the total is declared, uh, firstly as five and it's, that's our start value. Then, um, without the directly looking at the, um, function, we know that the, um, entered value is three. So, um, then locally is the grade declared as three times two.

So six. So we do total, which is five plus six, which is 12, 11, sorry. And then we do it again, but for, uh, one, so we have a local, which is equal to one times two. Give me one second, uh, Marco. Give me one. All right. So, so Marco was saying, okay, the first time

the update, um, method is called three. This value is the argument that receives. So in this line, value becomes three and then value is multiplied by two and that is assigned to local. So in this case, local is six plus total. So this 11 is total that was five plus the six that comes from

value times two. So at this point, total is 11, correct? Okay, keep going, uh, Marco. Okay, so then we do the same thing, but for one and we have that local is equal to one. Sorry, a value is equal to one. Then we do times two. So it's two.

And then, um, we added to the total we have, so 11 plus two, so 13. All right, so at the end, uh, that is 13. So the, the function without good assist, uh, final total is 13. Right, correct. So the final total is 13.

Um, so somebody was asking, um, to clarify what was value. Okay, so let me, uh, clarify that in a sec. All right, so in this, and I'm looking at this because I have the document here and over there. So if I don't look at the front place, excuse me. So, uh, this is what's going on,

right? This is the signature of the method, okay? This variable that is defined inside the parenthesis is what we call the parameter of the method and what that is is going to receive information, the method receive information. In this case, the type of information that the method

receive is an integer value. Now that value variable receives the value three. When we pass information to a method, then this three becomes what we call the argument. So the argument is the value that the parameter is going to receive. So the variable value becomes three.

So on this first line, then that's, this value in reality is the number three three times two six and that is assigned to the variable local. And then here we add, as we explain already, that value six to the total. Okay, now every time we call that method, then if we call it with a

different argument, the value of the parameter would change. Okay? So that will be that particular example. Any, any question on that? Anybody? We're good. Is that a little bit more clear than it was?

Give me thumbs up so I can, I can determine if you guys are good. All right? Excellent. All right, so let's continue. All right. I'm going to change to the previous document. So we can continue with that. Okay? All right. So we just trace this

this document. And here is the trace. Here is the actual trace. In the main total before any of the calls is five. Right? When we call update with the value of three, the local variable becomes six, total is still five has not been changed. But after they call to the

method update, then that variable, total becomes 11. So when the update method is called one more time with the value of one, then now the local variable is going to become two because it's two times one. And then total before the end of that is 11, but then we add two more, then it becomes 13. So at the

end, the output is 13. All right. So local variable is recreated each time the method update is called and runs, right? And it stops existence outside that method. But total since it's a field, it's going to maintain the value between the calls of the methods. So that's what makes it

acting like a global variable. Okay? So this is style of tracing is what the students are expected to do for IB questions. Okay? So you might be given in this case, what I share with you a second ago was a whole program. It could be that you just are given a segment of code. Okay?

But we have to get used to trace programs and what we're doing is really looking at the state of a variable. The state of a variable is nothing else that the value of the variable, the value of the variable as we go through the program itself. Okay? But that's a very common

aspect of those type of questions definitely on the assessment. All right. So here are a couple of examples of constructing programs that extract and eliminate super strings in Java, right? As I mentioned earlier, strings are objects.

And that means that they're going to be some methods associated with those strings. So here we have an example, right? Extrines are indexing. In this case, from zero to the length of the string, right? So the string here is hello. In the zero is the first h or the h on the work hello,

index one is e and then you go two, three, four. So in reality, the length of this string is five, but the index indexing, I'm sorry, started zero all the way to four. All right. So one of the methods that we can use for strings is char add. And what that is is we're able to get a particular

character of the string depending on the position that we supply. So in this case, char add is a method that requires an integer and that integer is in the index or represents the index that we want to access on the string. All right. So for example, here last, notice I want you to look at the syntax,

right? We're looking at let's go from the inside out right here. Let's start with this, right? So we declare a variable hello, right, which is of type string. So this statement inside the parenthesis, this statement by itself, the one I just highlighted is just going to get the length of the string. So in this case, the length of the string should be five, correct? Because that's how

long it is. We're subtracting one from it. So this becomes four. So we're saying that the last character of this string is the character at position four. And then the output or the not the output because we're not printing this anywhere. But the the result of this statement will be that we

are accessing the character in position four on the string, which in this case is oh, all right. So that's just to access one particular character. Obviously we will need the position, right? All right. So how can I get super strings from a particular string? There are

two ways to do that. So here we're defining a string that is super string one. And we are assuming that the arguments or the parameters of this method are two of them. The initial is where we want the super string to that we want to extract extract starts and where that super string ends. Okay. So this one requires both these other one.

Another the other method is that you just give them the star index and it will go from that all the way to the end of the string. Okay. So two things to take into account the star index is inclusive. But the end index is exclusive. So the character that is at the end index is not

taken when we take the super strings. Okay. And indices must go from zero to the length of the string. A very common mistake sometimes is to pass over the length of the string and trying to access a character. That's a very common mistake that sometimes we do. All right. Okay. So let's take a look

at this. So let's look at this example. So here we have the string text which is computer science. So word number one will go from zero which will be the character Z in this case all the way to the character eight. But remember that the eighth character is not inclusive. So the eighth

character goes up to there or he reads up to there but it doesn't include that character. So that's why the only super string or the characters of the super string that we will be able to get is just computer. Right. The eighth index is just the space. But that is not included. And then from

nine which is the S, we will go all the way to the end of the string and then capture that particular super string. All right. So those two ways to obtain something for a string. Finding positions with index of of the last index of. So let's look at this particular example.

So index of finds the first position where a super string occurs. So if you look at the email string, it has the student and the student name at and the school organization or the domain. Right. So in this case, this is going to return. It's going to give us a position

and index number where this will be. So what would be the answer of this particular statement? What will be what is the index value of the symbol add in this string? What it will be? You can just say seven. Which one is it? Seven. Seven. Right. Remember that the index is

started zero. So the return value will be seven. All right. On the last index of find the last appearance. Right. And that is useful for file extensions. So if we look at this example. Right. So we have no dot final dot version dot dot dot. Right. So if

lacks in this off, we want to know where is for what is the index of this particular point, but is the last one. So if we know that particular index number, so now we can take the service stream that is going to give us just the extension of the document because we're going to go from that position plus one. Right. Because they we don't want to include the dot. So we have

to go one more. So this will return this particular service string. Does it that may sense? We're good. All right. So let me see. So this is a common service string task that you might be asked on an assessment. I mean, not exactly that, but something similar to it. So let's see.

Let me one second. Okay. This is the whole thing. So yeah. So that is the whole program. Take a look at it. Kind of trace it and tell me what will be the output of this. It'll be school dot org. So the output should be O R G school dot org school dot org the whole

thing, right? The whole domain. All right. So let's take a look at that is correct. Let's look what this is done, right? So we have a method that is called get domain. The parameter of that method is a string. In this case, the string is going to be the email that we passed on.

And that method get domain has a local variable that is going to give me the position of the character at, right? It's going to give me that position. But it's not it's going to return. It's going to give me back

that position plus one. So let's look at this in more detail. Okay. Let's go back to this line. This is the signature of the method. Okay. Let's take a look at that for a second. So the name of the method is get domain. This string here is telling us the type

of information that this method is going to return. All right. So we'll go into more detail with the public study as we as we learn more Java. But right now, this is saying that the result of calling this method is to provide us with a string. That's what it says, right? So here we get

the position of the ad symbol through the index of, as we saw in the previous example, but what are we returning? So we are returning a sub-strain. What sub-strain? The string, the sub-strain that starts one more than the position where this symbol is at.

All right. So when this method is called in the main, which is called right here, right? It's called right there. Sorry. I don't know why you did that. All right. So, oh, because it thinks it's at a real email. So that's why it's right to do that. All right. So

when we call this as to an at a school dot org is the argument that is passed to the method. Right. We find the index of ad. We added one to it. And here we are returning that. So that means that we go from a school dot org all the way. And that's what is, that's what is return.

All right. So that also is tracing the program. What is the program doing? Any questions on that anybody on how this particular program will work? All right. So remember, you will have access to this to go on when we share it on the documents folder. All right. So here is the explanation,

right? We find the index of that. And then this takes everything after that position. All right. All right. So, um, less, less, less, less, let me see. What would be the result of this particular program there? Well, actually the answer is on your screen. So,

so I guess I don't need to ask that. But let's take an analysis of this, right? We have a method called invert name is going to return meaning it's going to produce a string. Right. And the parameter is another string. It receives something from us which has to be a

string. Right. So what is it going to do? So it's going to find where a space, the index where a space is and is going to store that position into the space position variable, which is an integer. And then since we are calling the input is at a low place. So that means that is actually

finding this position, the position of the space and that position will be what position? What is the exposition of the space should be three should be three, right? So the position here is three and then it's going to take the first name from position zero all the way to three. Remember,

this is not inclusive. So we don't take the space. So this first name now has the value of add or the string add in it. Right. And then the last name from the space plus one, it would be low place. And then all we do here is print in reverse order. This line, we haven't talked about

it, but this line, if you see, do you see the plus signs plus implies that is called concatenation of strings. Basically, we're putting those strings together. And there are actually three strings in this statement. The last name, the space and the comma and the last name. So the output

is going to be this. That will be the output of this particular program. Questions, comments, anybody? We're good. All right. If I'm going too fast, let me know. All right. Or too slow, also. All right. So manipulating service strings, we can use replace to alter part of a string.

So for example, here we have the sentence of the variable sentence, which is a string I love math. So the new sentence, we're going to replace a sewer string by another. So you just give them what you want to replace and what you want to replace by. That's all the arguments that you need.

So when you use, when you print that particular new sentence, then it will become I love computer signs. All right. So as I mentioned earlier, concatenating strings is just adding them this particular way. So you can add that information and produce one string. You could ask in this example, just

concatenate them and assign to another variable string. Okay. And we can also build service strings from from different pieces. All right. So for example, we have this code. We can get the service string that goes from five to seven, which is computer science, the code of the class.

We can take the service string from the eighth position all the way to the end, 2027. And then now, I can build a new string just by concatenating those two pieces of information. Okay. So that is build them a string from other pieces. Right. This is a very important for us to

understand because this will be something that eventually you're going to be using to make sure that your program works properly in case the user inputs the wrong type of information. Right. We need to handle that. And what that is is called handling exceptions.

When we're running the program and maybe we want to access a file that is not there. We don't want the program to crash. We actually want the program to be able to handle that situation. It's looking for a resource. It's not there. What happens? Or if we ask for a particular type of

information and the user by mistake or whatever just provides something that is not the type of information that we need, then we need to handle that. We don't want the program or program to crash just because it's not receiving the correct input. All right. So the syllabus

asks us to know to handle unexpected inputs. Right. And determine if a resource is available or not available. That means if we're going to open a file or is the file that's the file access. What we're looking for it or not with the program should handle that and managing some logic errors, possible logic errors. Okay. So unexpected inputs happens when the user enters information that is

different from what we're asking. And when that happens, usually what happens is if like in this case, right, the user enter a letter instead of numerical value, then that's going to give you a number form and exception or something similar. And what the compiler is going to tell you is like look

wrong information, right. And if you're expecting an numerical value and you are going to manipulate that value to do some kind of arithmetic, then obviously if it's not an numerical value, the arithmetic won't be able to be performed. Correct. So we need to handle that. So here we have

a variable called input ABC, which is obviously it's a string. But here we're trying to make that variable converted or parsed that variable into an integer. Right. And as signed that to this variable, this will give us a number formal exception, right. It's an error

that we will probably need to handle. Let's say that we are asking for, I don't know, the course code. And instead of a numerical value of five, seven, two, the user enter five, by mistake, it type a letter in between the characters of the numbers that represent the code.

Well, that will create an error on that input. So we need to handle that. Okay. When we look for resources, one very common is when the file does not exist and cannot be opened. All right. All when we're trying to connect to a network or use a printer and the printer is offline or the printer is no longer there for some reason, right. Or the database is not available right now. So

instead of our program crashing, we need to handle that. We need to know, okay, in this case, what are we supposed to do? All right. So since this is to either read for a file or access a resource, there are called input, output exceptions, right. Or something that is related to input

to our program. Logic errors might be something like divided by zero that will cause an arithmetic reception and array that we are trying to access outside the length of the array. That will create an exception also or using reference that is null that will cause a null point exception. That means that we're trying to access that something that is empty or we're trying to

manipulate the value something that is empty and obviously if there is no value, then we can no manipulate that. So those are going to be errors that might happen. All right. So where is the purpose handled this? Right. We want to catch up runtime errors. We want to respond in a

control way. We don't want our program to crash because of that. Right. Avoid complete program crashes, show helpful messages to users, prompt users to please input the proper information, clean resources like closing files. Every time we access files, we need to close because

otherwise the files might be corrupted. Okay. All right. So here is a common way that we manage these exceptions. Right. Is the is the try cache final structure? So the try cache final structure, as you can see, each each part has its own blog of code. And this the code on the try is code

that might throw an exception. So email may not actually throw the exception, but we are anticipating that the user may not enter the proper input. We might anticipate that the file is no longer there because it was removed or that the resource may not be available. So we are anticipating that

as a possible scenario. Right. So the catch is going to specify what type of error happened. And then based on the type of exception that happened, we are going to determine what to do. Right. We might decide to prompt the user for the correct information. We can decide to tell the

user the file is no longer there or the printer is not available or there is no network connection or the database is is not available so on and so forth. Okay. One second. Yes. This document will be in the in the share folder. Okay. Okay. Somebody was asking that. And

yes, it will be it will be there. All right. Okay. So we can have, I'm sorry, the finally, the finally is code that always runs. Always this piece of code is going to run. Now you can have but you can handle exceptions just having that try and catch. You don't necessarily have to have

the final but it's a good practice to have it. Okay. And I'll explain why that is a different. Now move. Do you have a question? Yeah. I was going to ask why we need finally. I can't. Finally, finally, you want to have it there because usually you want to close any files

or any resources that that were open. Okay. So that's why it's always it's always there to to guarantee or make sure that we you you okay, I'm back is raining over here and I just lost connection. Right now I'm working with my

the hotspot of my phone. So I don't know how good the connection is going to be but I'm going to try to continue. Okay. So if he incase the power goes off, I still have connection with my phone. All right. So let me share again the document.

Okay. So I was saying that the final is if you don't have to, the final is optional. Okay. It's a good practice because it's where you want to close any resources that you have maybe open or try to open. Clean up a little bit. Okay. But it doesn't have to.

All right. Okay. So you can have multiple cash blocks. It depends on the type of handling errors that you're trying to to manage. Right. So for example, here, you might want to handle an input output exception.

Here, you can just ask me. I'm sorry. I can't see the screen. Oh, you cannot. Maybe we can reconnect. Say it works. You need to refresh the page. It works for me. No, I would. Okay. You guys can see it. Can you see them? I refresh the page and now I can't see it.

Okay. Thank you for that. Okay. So just do that, please. Just refresh. All right. Where was I? Okay. Right here. So I was saying that we can have different different or more than one catch block. Okay. All right. So here we are going to

look at this example. It's kind of long. So I'm going to try to feed it. All right. Let's let's try to look at here because I modify this program to actually work. This one is the one that will will create an input output error or handling exception.

Right. So let's look at this. All right. So these are Java classes that we need when we are managing files. Okay. The buffer reader, the file reader, and input output exception, which is the one that manage any possible error. Let's plane this a little bit in a second. Okay.

But those are classes that we're going to need when we manage files. Right. So here we have a class, which is the class file. Right. And here we have the main method. So the first thing we it is that we declare a buffer reader and that the name of that reader is reader and is null just to start and notice that then we go into the tried catch exception.

Right. So this let's go from the inside out. Right. Let's try to explain this. So here the file reader is an argument of the buffer reader. Okay. So the file reader is kind of the actual connection of the physical connection between the file and our program. Okay. The file reader is going to

read the information on the file byte by byte. What the buffer reader does is actually instead of reading one byte at a time, he just buffer an amount of bytes. It makes the reading, I will say, faster. Okay. So it's kind of establishing the connection here with the file. And

this allows to read a buffer of bytes, which help us read the file faster. So here we have a variable call line is of type a string. And what we're going to do is use this reader to read line by line. So when we read a line, we're not reading one character at a time. We'll just

buffering the whole line. Okay. So that's basically what's happening there. And then here, we're going to print the first line. Okay. If we try to open this file data and data.text does not access, then we're actually going to jump or the execution of the program is going to jump to the cache. And it's going to say error in the file. This is where the message that the compiler generates

is stored. Okay. And this is us managing the exception. Right. And we're managing the exception by using what the compiler is throwing at us. And that is called a throw an exception. Right. Throw a message because something happened. And then we just captured that here. And then that information

is printed. I'm going to give you an example in a second. So here we have the final part. Right. In the in the try, we attempt to open and read the file. Right. If that didn't happen, correct. And I'm sorry, you know, if if that was successful, the file now is open. Right. We read all the

information. And now if the reader is not is different than null, that means that we did have access to the file and we read the file, the information, the file now the file is open. So namo, why do I need this? Well, now here we is a good part where I close the resource.

In this case, I close the file. There is no more access to that particular file. Now I know finally, I'm sorry. I can't just move that reader that close into the try block. Yeah. So, so that is that this, well, in the final, we have a try cache, right. Yeah.

Because something might happen during reading the file, the information can, it depends. Let me put this section, it could be possible that more than one application is trying to access that file. So if the file remains open, if there is the chance that the file might get corrupted.

So what we want to do is make sure that if we use a resource, once we we will not use the resource anymore, we release it. In this case, the way to release it will be to close the file, in a sense. And we check if releasing that file here with this particular cache inside

the final was successful or not, right. If we couldn't close for any risk on the file, then now we are also handling that exception, that positivity. All right. We are already handling the session before. So I don't remove that reader that close into the try block before.

We could try to add that in there. And I don't think there would be any issue with it. What we're trying to do is organize our code in a way that here we know that, okay, here I'm reading the file, right. I finished with that. And we're just guaranteeing that this

closed the file. Remember what I said earlier? Do I have to find a final? No, I don't, right. So I could take this action there. What this does is give a better organization of the code, because you're like decomposing what you're doing with the resources and how you handle in the exceptions. Okay. All right. So now I'm going to show you how this works. Okay. So I'm going to

actually share my netbeams with you guys. Let me see if I can do that. Let me see if this allows me to, it should, it should allow me to do that because I think that power is interesting. Okay. So let me stop sharing this. And let's see if I can

do it again. You want one? I can't put this here. File reader is some power. Let me put that up there. Okay. Netbeams. Netbeams. Let's try to set this up. So I can share that.

with you guys. Window. One second, I need to change my settings. Looks like

You You You You You You Look at the I don't have in this particular example, not the final so this is just a try and cash all right so There is this file that I'm going to attempt to read.

If you look on the panel to the left of the screen right here, this is the, yes, this is the fiber in example, this one. So in net bins, in order for us to be able to read a particular file, that file, at least in this example, needs to be where my code is.

So here I have, I'm sorry, that's not it. One second. See, it's so small.

File reading example, this one. Source package. All right, here.

That's what I wanted to show you. So here is my project of the file reading example. And here is the file.

It's called today that I'm going to to read. Okay. So I was saying that in net bins, in order for me to be able to do this example is I need this text file to be in the same folder where my dot Java file is.

Okay. And in order to be able to read it, I'll have to provide the path where that particular file is.

Okay. So let's look at this for a second. We're going to do two things with this file.

One is see how it works. And second, we're going to do the next section of the file of the of today's class, which is kind of debugging.

All right. I'm going to show you what you can do to kind of debug this type of files or any other file. Okay.

All right. So the tried, as I said, in the previous example, right. We define first the path of the file, right.

It's a string, which is going to have where the file is located. We define a buffer reader. In this case, the reader.

Then a file reader is declared. Remember, that's the physical connection between the program and the file reader and the file. We just create the object in which you're going to read with the clear string variable call line, which is what we are going to use to store the lines that we read from the file.

Okay. All right. So introducing line debugging.

Line debugging is a method in which you can debug your programs using the environment that your IDE, in this case, the Japanese. For example, I'm going to double click on this and notice that I double click on the number of the line where I am.

Or where I want to start the debugging process. And if you look at the top navigation bar of netbeens, this is where you can debug your program line by line. Okay.

So first, I'm going to run the program without doing the debugging and see how it works. And then we'll do a little bit of debugging just to see how actually they go from the try to the catch. So let's do that.

So I'm going to run this program is just going to read that file and print it on the screen, hopefully, without any issues. And this is the file, right?

Is this little point? Okay. All right.

So it works. Open the file. No problem.

Right. Everything works. All right. So I'm going to make this a comment.

And then I'm going to use this, which is not existing. Okay. So I'm going to try to open that particular file.

Okay. So now we are going to run the program again. And then now there is an error, right?

There is an error because it's telling me that an input output exception just occur. Because this file doesn't exist. There is no such file of or a directory, right?

Okay. So let's take a look. We're going to then try to run this.

Of the bug. Right. We're going to see what's going on.

At least see how actually works. Does it make sense? So we're going to run the debugging line by line.

And then notice that is this windows to on the left panel, open. Right. This one's right here.

We are going to be debugging. Here are some evaluation of expressions. And here we're saying that we're using the line reading the file that we're using.

Okay. So this icon here allows you to step over the line that you are at. Okay.

So let me move this down so we can see how it moves from one line to the next. So we click on it and then you jump from this line, line 20 to line 24. Right.

Buffering reading this one. So if I step to that and we're trying to open a file that does not exist. Then the execution of the program should jump from there to the catch.

Okay. So notice that the when is straight to that. Do you see that?

Because so he catch the exception. It never went over this block of code. He jumped directly to there.

If we go over, then it's going to print here. What happens? Right.

Right there. And if we stop over that, then. All the stack print the stack trace is all this that is just printed there.

And the execution of the program ends. Right. So this is what is called line the bugging.

Right. And it's done. Uh, directly on your IDE. Most ideas have this option for us to, uh, to be able to.

To what to debug the problem. Now, let's change it, change this back. And let's look at one more time when there is no.

Uh, error. Okay. All right.

So we're going to do exactly the same thing. We're going to go to the bug. This right there.

And hopefully we'll be able to see. That this time around. Instead of jumping from the tried.

To issue go to the next. Instead of jumping to the catch. I'm sorry, it should go inside the tri block of code.

Okay. What is where the green line is is going to read that. What happened?

I did something. Let me do it again. Okay.

There you go. I stopped here. Okay.

So it gets to the tri block of code. Prince that notice at the bottom. That line of code just was printed.

Now we're on the while. It reads the first line. And it prints the first line.

Right. So right now we are on that. Code.

Right. And that code in this case is a is a while loop. So we're going to stay there until we read.

The whole file. Okay. Almost done with that.

And then there is no catch exceptions to happen. And with that, we're done. Right.

Okay. So that is something that I wanted you guys to see because you are going to be managing files. Right.

And then there is only through your eye right either text files where you're going to either. As in the most project. I don't know how he's intent to handle that, but he might create text files with the information, the organization, so on and so forth.

Right. So I wanted you to see that. Let me stop sharing.

Let me see. Or this one. This is another exception handling.

Take a look for a moment to that. To that example, this one has a final and see where a mistake might happen. And then raise your hand and and and share with us what where do you think the error is.

Is happening. Anybody other than then the move. Any other brave soul.

Yes, I guess maybe no. Okay, now move. So what's going on here?

So first it will define try to define in an entire array. Then it will run successfully. Then for the next line, it will try to access the index 10.

But the length of the array is only three. That's correct. It will create a letter.

That's going to be. All right, so let's. Let's run it.

Right. So. Here is the error.

Right. See. A rate index does not exist.

Index 10 is out of bounds for length three. Notice that all we have in. In the print line is array index that not at six.

Everything else from then on is what the compiler actually produces is the is the exception is the throne exception. Okay. All right, so.

Is there any other example that I have. Okay, yes, I do have this one, which is another way to debug our programs, you know, is debugging using print lines. So for example, in this particular code.

We're trying to find the maximum of an array of integers. Okay. And sometimes it's difficult to follow that.

When especially when you have a loop. All right. So sometimes you want to add print statements embed temporary print statements inside your code to see what is the program producing.

Right. Is a way to debug. Obviously you will remove those print statements afterwards after you have check and debug your program is just this is just an example of how to do it.

Right. So here we have. A method called find maximum find max has a parameter, which is an array of integer values.

What it does is the first element of the array, we define that to be the max. And what we're going to do inside this loop really is compare that value. With the other elements of the array.

And if one element of the array is bigger than max, then we swap the values, we change the maximum right. So I'm going to run this again, and I'm going to do the line debugging here one more time. And.

All right. So here we are on the loop, right. Nothing has been produced here on the output.

And then we stop over that. And this is the nice feature for debugging notice where we just jump. So it's telling me, OK, I started at zero and it goes after length six because that's the length of the array.

OK. If you look at the line where the green is highlight the green, it tells you the value of I. And what is the maximum at that point.

So it provides you information so you can follow or trace the program. All right. From there, it's just going to compare is the value.

Is the maximum right, which is five is that still higher than the value at index zero. If it is, then you're going to change it. If it's not, it won't change it.

So notice that the first value of the following value is three. So five is still the maximum value. So it shouldn't change, right.

So. Here, current value is still what five because five is still bigger than three. The maximum doesn't change.

Same thing happens with the following, which is four. So we check the value is is not the maximum. And it's going to go through this for every index in the array.

OK. So it finds a value of seven. And now the maximum value is going to be updated.

All right. So new maximum is seven. And it will continue to do so until we get to the end of the.

D array. OK. And so here I combine two things.

One is the print statement, right, to debug the program. And the other is using the. Online debugging or the line debugging that is provided by the IDE.

That that may sense. All right. So let me stop sharing that.

And let's go back to the original. Oh, the original file is not here. So we want to second because since I lost connection, I probably.

You All right. All right.

So now you were asking if this file to share this file on the chair folder is already there. There are now two folders. Turn one.

Turn two. The file is on their. Turn two.

So make sure you. You access it. OK.

All right. So here. Here we are on the file that we started the lesson with.

So debugging techniques. We did two. One of them is tracing a table.

Right. And for trace a table, basically, you are creating a record of the state of the variable. The values that the variable takes to.

Determine what will be the final value of the value variable or variable that you're interested in. Right. So that's a trace table.

You look at the steps. In this case, there are three steps. And notice that.

What I have shown you is we usually trace a stuff that. Well, we can trace anything. But usually when we have loops and we want to keep track of what the loop is doing.

Abdul, give me a second. And then I'll try to share the folder with you again. OK.

All right. So. That's what we will do.

The other is using the print statements. This is what I just show you there. Break point.

The bugging is what I show you on also on netbeams, right? Clicking on one particular line. The program.

You execute the program one line by line. And that's what we're. All right.

What most common is to use is a combination of all those techniques, depending on how big. The issue is with the program and what you are trying to. The bug.

OK. So here I'm going to ask you a couple of I be questions. OK.

And with that, we're going to end the. We're going to end today's. Today's lesson.

But. Here's some of the questions break. So I have to prepare a document for that.

Let me try to. To find that document. We try to find that document first.

OK. And then with that, we'll, we'll finish. Thank you.

All right. I found it. So just give me a second here.

All right. Can you see that? Everybody.

All right. So let's see. All right.

I'm going to start with this. As we did earlier, I want you to. Trace this.

Document. And provide. And answer to the output for for a.

On the private chat. OK. Take your time.

When you're ready. Just. I see a couple of responses already.

So. All right. All right.

All right. I see some similar answers. OK.

Anyway, I highlighted the the count. But it also would be easy to kind of keep track of what that is. Sophia, you cannot paste.

Can you type it though? It's complicated on the tablet. Oh, you're not tablet.

OK. All right. OK.

Good, good, good work. Appreciate go back and check it. Yeah, Michael, you can if you want to a problem.

These questions are on that document that is in the share folder. OK. I just organized in here to be able to see the whole question in one piece.

Because over there it was kind of. OK. Akmal.

We're going to discuss it in a second. OK. But you're in the right track.

OK. Is that the answer for par B? Explain what the value count is at method eight is different.

Or you're referring to. All right. All right.

I'll have that into account. We're going to go over it anyway. What's going on, Sophia?

What is funny? Go ahead. Now, may I please tell verbally once within?

Yeah. Because it's really. No problem.

No problem. All right. All right. So let's let's start with par B.

OK. Let's start with par B because I think par B. Give us understanding of what's going on with the actual values, my sense. All right.

So. OK, Sophia, go ahead. So initial, we initialize two different methods, method A and method B.

Each of these methods use global variables and local variable. We have one global variable, which is one and local variables. Well, method A introduces the local variable count five, which is a valid only for this method.

And it increases this variable by two. So the output of the method A is seven. There is a method B calls for calls for the global variable one and.

F three to it. And that's why we receive two separate answers because we have local variables for each separate methods and a global one. Right. So here, this is local.

It only exists. In method A, right. Here, count is not defined or declared.

So count here is the field or global, right. So in this line. That refers to this count.

Correct. The method A modifies the local variable, but it doesn't have any effect on count been equal to one. Correct.

Method B is using the global. So that is going to change this particular value. So it's adding three to it.

So it should be so the final output should be what? What should be the output here for the output that should be for, right. The output that should be for because this for is the actual modification of this variable count.

Correct. So that's a good exercise is tracing and knowing the difference between local and field variables or global variables. Okay.

Is there anybody that has a question about what we just explained? If you do Sophia is answering those questions because she's in charge right now. Or Ricardo Ricardo, you got it right.

Almost everybody got it right. Okay. Okay.

So par B, why the value count inside method is different from the value printed in method B? Because one is a local variable and the other is a field. I sense that's the difference.

So one is modified by method B, while the other one is not. Okay. Let me see.

All right, let's. Let's try problem three. Let's try to read that.

Why would that be the case? Anybody raise your hand if you want to kind of explain that? Okay.

Namu, go ahead. Namu or Sophia, you can compliment each other. Namu, go ahead.

So first please, static means that the value of the variable is shared across all objects of the class. So it belongs to the class. And it's instances.

So you can access it inside a method without needing to pass that variable. That is correct. Right.

So it becomes a variable that can be used anywhere in the code. Right. So there is no need to pass it as an as an argument.

Right. Okay. This one.

This will be a little bit more complex because we have to do. We have to write a piece of code. Right.

It's not a whole program. But I want you to think about a problem seven for a minute. Okay.

See if you're able to kind of develop a little. So lines of code that will accomplish that. And obviously you don't have to write it, but you could just tell us.

The steps, right? The steps that the program. And you can make to accomplish what problem seven a is asking.

And with this, we're going to. We're going to end the class is two hours and I. I hope that it was.

Interesting enough for you to stay the two hours with me today. So whenever. You're ready, kind of to explain how you will approach seven a.

Let me know. Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. All right. Anybody.

Anybody want to give it a shot. Now, let me check if there is anybody else. Okay.

All right. So let's do this since. Okay.

Marco also. All right. Let's hear it from Marco.

Marco, go ahead. Then let's do this. Now move.

Be ready to try to do B. And Sonja, if you don't mind, see if you're able to come up with an answer for eight. Okay.

All right. Marco, go ahead. Okay.

So my answer was that year, like I declared a variable a year to take it as the extracted part equals code dot substring and the parentheses eight. So that I will take the all the values after the eighth character.

Okay. All right. That.

So how do you know is the eighth character? Because I counted it. Okay.

So you counted. Is there a way to identify where to start without counting? Yeah.

After the using the. What was it? Maybe if it starts with a 20 like a.

All right. So remember, there is one. They are that I can.

I can help you find the last index of. Right. So remember the example when we use the dot.

I will. Yeah. Last of.

Last of. All right. So then you could use the last of the dash.

Because that will tell you the index where the 2027 starts. Right. And then I add one.

Correct. And then you that add one. And then with the super string, you can.

Extract what you need. That's in my sense. Namu.

Did you maybe thought of something different? We can call index of. Which argument.

Yes. Okay. And it'll.

Catch where. Yes, it's. Then we can add three.

So get where the ears start. Where the ears start. Okay.

That's another possibility. Yes. All right.

Son. Son. You did you thought of something different than those two possibilities.

Sophia. I've been focusing on the eight, but I think it's. All right.

All right. So let's do B. Let's do B.

Namu. Let's try to do B. And then we move to eight.

And with that. I'm going to let you go to enjoy the rest of your Saturday. I think it's about to start.

I don't know if you probably is ending. So. Go ahead.

For part B. Namu. So you'll define.

You declare a call. That string code equals to IBDP. Yes, 2007.

27. Uh-huh. Then.

We will call index of. So that variable. We see argument.

CS. That's the string. Okay.

All right. Return the index where CS starts. Then if you want to find the index where 2017 starts.

We can add three to it. And then extract. We will call some string.

Which stand up there. All right. Yeah, that will work.

All right. So if you are ready for not for eight. Are you?

I think we had this one actually as the example. So basically we need to create a new method. Well, public static stream.

It will be with the name format name. And we need to accept. String as a variable.

Well, let's say full name. Well, label it full name. Then the program starts and we need.

Not the method starts. So we need to identify the space. The index of space.

In. In the input. Yes.

And then once we have identified the index of this space. We. We can identify last name, which will be at the position.

Well, we. Okay. It will be.

Full name. Some string. And then space plus one.

Yes. Then we can identify the first name. In the name.

The first name, which will. Start at the. At zero.

And at the. Space position. The index of space.

Yes. And we return. We return the first name.

Then well, it can. If we decide to go with. A comma.

We. Plus. Add.

A string with comma. And then. And then.

And then. So we had this one. Yeah.

But. I still little written it. All right.

So I was just going back and written of your answers. For the previous problems. And.

Well. That's. That's all we.

I have for you guys today. If you still don't have. If you still don't have.

Share folder. Stay with me. So I can probably fix that right now that you are with me.

And. One second. And.

I would like for. Come out to stay for a second to clarify something. And.

What do you just share with us? Please. Give me one second.

Oh, okay, sorry, she cannot speak. All right, so that's it for today for me, guys. You can leave if you like.

If you need to stay for me to help you with accessing the folder or for anything else, then I can stay with you for a few minutes.

Akmal, please stay because I wanna clarify what you ask. Okay, everybody else, then I'll, I'll see you next week. Okay.

Thank you. You're welcome. Take care, everybody. Thank you.

Bye. Bye. Bye. I just want to ask a quick question for the US I meant for week 10.

I know that we are supposed to program and stuff. And I did all the programming and it's all working properly. How was it to file files that you understand?

Like what file format do you want us to send? I'm sorry, go ahead and repeat the question. I, I, there is some noise I couldn't hear you clearly.

So I, I finished the week 10 assignment. Okay. Before the code and everything in the different project files.

But I was just wondering, they, which file format should I submit it as in the promotion program application? Okay, so if it is a program, okay, what I want you to do is to make sure that you, Russian, I, we haven't met to decide this.

But I want you to save it as a text file because I'm assuming that I'm going to have to try to run it and check if it works.

Okay. A text file. Right.

Okay, let me just open it up real quick to see like if you're on the same page. So I go files, I file save.

Give me one. And go ahead, keep going. It only gives me the option for dot Java.

That's true, that's true. So what you, what, what I mean is this, okay. Go ahead and what are you using Windows or Mac?

I'm using Mac. Okay. So find the text editor that max brings.

I think it's called text edit. Text edit. Right.

And then, then do this. Copy the program, copy and paste the program there and save it as a text file.

And I need to, I need to clarify that with the other teacher because in my, is the text edit? Yeah, it's called text edit, correct.

Okay, so I'm in text at a new document. So copy and paste from netbeams, copy and paste there, save it as a text file.

Because if it's a text file, no rich text file, just text file that entire everything, everything, because then I will have to run it in that way.

I can copy and paste it and run it on my end when I need to. Okay, but I'm going to have to clarify with, with rash.

Okay. It's only allowed me to export as PDF. For some reason.

Yeah. Export as PDF is the only option. Aw.

You know what? Do me a favor then. Cause then, then send me an email on, on canvas cause I'm going to have to ask rash.

How, how we're going to handle that? Okay. Cause I don't, I don't, I don't know for sure.

Okay, so I know that it can't submit it. They, yeah, so net, and netbeams, I know we can export the file, the whole package, but I don't know, let me ask, cause I don't have, I really don't have a certain answer for you.

Okay, and yes, if you, if that is an impediment for, for submitting the work, then I'll, I'll have to see how we can manage that.

Okay. Okay, so when would I expect I can update on this? Because I want to, I'm going to email rash.

Actually email both of us. Can you do that email on the, on the, on campus? Okay.

And on, right, on canvas and then ask how should you submit? What type of file should you submit it? Because I don't have an answer for it really.

Okay. So in that way, he will, he will see it. And should I specify the problems I'm facing with the file formats for each application?

Right, right. And then in that way, he can help both of us, because as I said, I don't really know how that's going to work.

Okay. Okay. Thank you.

You're welcome. Have a great rest of the day. You too.

Sarah, what's going on? Hi, Mr. Martin. Can you hear me?

Yes, I can hear you. Regarding what we, I had asked you about last week, my school still wants me to do like a mock exam for computer science.

And they said that if you guys aren't able to make an exam, is it possible for you guys to provide topics to them for them at the school to make the exam on their end?

Okay. Let me, I'm going to make, I'm going to take, make notes of that.

And I know it sounds like I repaired it stuff, but I, I am new at this with Pamolia. And I don't know what they, what the policies are for that.

So I'm going to say mock exam or provide a mock is done for you guys. That's basically the question, right?

Provide a mock exam for Sarah. Provide either a develop one or provide topics for this school to create one.

Am I right on that? Yeah. Okay.

Yes. Yes, I have the same thing as well. So like, I'm like, on January, I have the mock exam.

And then like, I don't know, like, how would it work because I'm doing a chill. And I'm like, only the one in the class.

So I don't know how would it work for me as well because I have a mock exam as well. All right.

What, what day do you have that program? It's on January more, I'll check now. It's like from, I think so on the 15th of January, something like that.

Okay. All right. Well, again, then I'm going to, I'm going to try to find out an answer for that.

And I'll be emailing you this coming week. Both of you, Sarah and you. Thank you, Sarah.

Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.

You're welcome, Sarah. I have a good rest of the day. Alma.

Alma. Hello, who are you? I'm good.

Thank you. How are you? Pretty good.

Thanks. I just wanted to quickly talk to you about downloading Java since I haven't been able to do that.

Okay. The links provided through like the tasks for this week, week 10, but I entered the links and then I didn't know what to press to like download it.

So you haven't been able to install Java? Yes. Same, sir.

Same, same with. Same, yes, sir. I also like it.

I tried to try to install with the teacher in my school. And then like, we weren't able to do it. I don't know why.

Maybe it's like something on my laptop or the website that was provided on the worksheet. Like we tried many times, but it didn't work.

So like I wasn't able to install it on time. Okay. Let me see.

So you guys were able to... So you did access the... You had you access the document that we have in the chair of all the press?

Yes, sir. Okay. What what machine do you have?

I have my map. I'm to enter truth, yes. My empty chip.

Okay. Did you... Were you able to at least download the software?

I installed from the Oracle website. I think it was called X64DMG, which I did that. And then for the netbeans, I also downloaded, I think it was 28 netbeans.

But then like it's like on my laptop, but like I cannot access it or open it. I have the netbeans 28.

What... What message did you get? Like it's not like opening.

I have the file, but I don't have the... Yes, it has an automatic access. Yes, it has an open.

I have the files and everything, but like it's not like opening. Is this your personal computer or school computer? No, no, it's my personal one.

It's your personal one. So I would just ask him because then there is no restriction. But I spoke with my school.

If you guys are happy to do it, then they will like let me use the school laptop, like the PC to access it. If you guys let me do that because I spoke with my IT in my school.

And then he wasn't able to install it from my laptop. On your laptop? Yeah.

So they said if you guys let me, then they will like do it for the school's PC, then I will be able to let code and do the programming over there. Right.

Look, I don't have an issue with that. I mean, I don't see why using netbeans in one computer or other is an issue. I don't see that.

So if that solves your problem, I will tell you, go ahead and do that. You know what? I would like to have it on my laptop so I can do it like whatever.

And whenever I want to, obviously that will be the best option. But yeah, so to avoid for you to probably be behind, right? At least get the school computer and try to do that there.

Because I will have to probably be with you like make an individual appointment and try to try to do it together. Do you understand what I'm saying?

Yes, right. So you will have to share this one, right? Share your screen and everything and then try to do that.

Because otherwise, we will have to go. I will, what I will do really is going through all these documents step by step, okay, and see where the process kind of fails if it does, okay?

Okay. Yes, ma'am. For me, I'm able to open it.

It's just I'm confused on like what to do if that makes sense. So for me, it's not really a software issue. It's more of like confusion.

Confusion. All right, well, let's, let's do this. Alma Goharan, I just allow you to share.

Is in this machine that you have it? Share my screen, okay, wait, let me see. And we'll see Abdul, do you have any question?

Abdul? Sir, no, I'm just here because I'm having an issue with the share folder. Whenever I try to log in, it says that there's some issue that prevents you and you don't have access.

Okay, do me a favor on a private chat. Share your email with me, please, okay, I'm doing it right now. So I'm going to try it again.

All right, let me, let me look. Abdul, I just send you an email to that address, try to see if allows you to allow you to get access to it.

All right, Alma, so what's going on? So I press this, right? Correct.

And then. So I thought you said that you have the software already, so did you download it already or not? No, because I get confused here.

I tried to ask the IT in my school and they didn't know. So they told me to ask the teacher. Okay, that's fine.

All right, so Java development kid, okay. Okay, go ahead and. Oh, wait, sorry.

Problem. Access, let me know. So I'm here now, which one do I press?

Okay, give me one second. Give me one second. I'm going to read that document that I was reading because.

I was like, install the thing from the same, the same place. I went on the mark. Oh, it's sad because I have a Mac and then from there and like I did the X64, the MG one.

Is that correct? What you should have. Let me see.

Come to Java. Give me one more second. So I just want to make sure that we are following steps.

Okay. All right. Windows installation.

Give me one second. Mac. All right, so.

Alma, what machine do you have? A Mac or a. All right, so then let's do this before we download anything.

Open the terminal. Okay, just press command space. Okay.

And then type terminal. Like this. Yeah.

And then find that application. There you go. Okay.

What access to it? Mr. Martin sir. You have access to it?

Yes, it's fine now. Thank you. Well, you're welcome.

Have a great rest of the day then. Okay. You do sir likewise.

I'll see you. See you later. Bye.

All right. So Alma. So now go ahead and type Java.

Mr, I want to me type. I will now. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

And there. All right, what does he say? Operation couldn't be completed unable to locate a Java runtime.

Please visit. Okay. So it looks like you don't have.

Java in your. In your computer. And it needs to be.

Install. One sec. Okay.

Okay. Well, is giving me. I'm doing the same thing.

But it's giving me the same message. So, and I know I have. So I don't know.

What the deal is. Okay. It appears.

Max. My project to start Java. You can skip that.

Okay. So we're not. Okay.

So. Let me see. I'm going to.

I'm going to type something on the chat. So you can do that. So.

So right there on the terminal. Try to. Right.

This is a command. I just pasted on the chat. Okay.

Should I share my screen as well? Yeah. Because I want to.

I want to see what's going on. Act mal. You still there.

So you also have a Mac. Correct. Yes.

Well, let's try to. Let's see if you're able to follow what we're doing with. I did the same thing.

And it said that I have the version. 25.0.1. I put on my terminal.

I wrote Java. It's the version. Any game in Java version.

25.0.1. Okay. So.

I already have the files and everything. But like, I just going to open the. Like the.

I don't know why it's not. It's not opening for me. I have the Java.

And then the. It means as well. Okay.

Give me one second. So, Alma, you say that no much found. Right.

Yeah. Okay. One more try.

Or something here. I think just to install the ARM. One of the 64 one because I had the same issue.

And then when I did the ARM 64. From the Mac OS version. And then it worked for me.

Which one? You go to the Mac OS there. And top left.

So. You see what it says. Alma, you see that?

No, go back. Okay. You see at the top says Linus max and window.

Oh, yes. Yeah, there. And then you go to the RARM 64 DNG.

This one, right? No, I know this. It depends which.

Which Mac will you have? Which I'm like what should you have? Yeah, depends on your machine.

But. The one she's he stole is the last one. Am I right?

This one? Yes. Yeah.

That's what he stole. So, Alma, try to. To do the same.

Now stop sharing and. I'll show me your your screen. Well, you said that it doesn't open.

I want to see what might be. How do you see my screen, sir? Yeah, share the screen.

Can you see my screen now? Because I'm trying to. Well, not really.

Oh, it moves. How about now? Is it working now?

No, it's not working. I just see the same. Oh, now it's about now.

Now. So, like, I put the job version and it's any him in this. Okay.

And when I go to my files to my downloads and then first search net pins. Because I have the thing also the net pins here. I have the file here, but like I kind of open it.

You can. That folder. No, because when I press it, it goes here.

So like, I don't know what to do here. Wait, wait a sec. It looks like.

Because usually. Usually it becomes like. Something that you need to unpack on install.

So let's see. Let's go back to that. No, no, stay there.

Scroll down. I want to see. Oh, net pins.

Of course. Okay. Do you see the third file there?

Go back up. You see a file that one, the. This one.

Yeah. That one. That's the download and a sip.

Click on that. But says this. Can resume this download this file.

That's how to redo it. Looks like. Because what you want is once you download it looks like all you got to do is.

You will see on your desktop something that looks like a. Drive. And then from there, you just click on it and ask to install to install.

I think I did that already when I do my first download it. And then you did that and it gave you all this. Yes, they gave all this like I did that and it gave all this.

Okay, click on your finder. Oh, no, right there. Click on applications.

Go to applications on the right on the right panel. Is net being somewhere in there? No, it's not there.

So. Well, it looks like you might want to see if you're able to remove. What you have on it, beans.

And then try to download it again and see if that works. Because when I did for the Python, like it was like fast and quick for Java. I don't know.

Okay. Well, try to do that and let me know. Okay.

Yes, sir. I would like. I would like to let you know if anything goes wrong.

All right. Thank you, Admiral. Thank you, sir.

Thank you so much for everything. You're welcome. Alma, how's it going?

I did download the software. It worked. So.

Now I'm going to see if I can download Net Beans. All right. Go ahead and then let me know if you have issues.
