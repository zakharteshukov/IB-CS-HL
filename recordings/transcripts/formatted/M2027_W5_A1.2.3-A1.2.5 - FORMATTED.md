## CLASS INTRODUCTION & ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS

We have total 24 students one of you have not yet marked attendance was that I see 23 entries so far. Who is left for the attendance please have a look at the names so you can see if your name is missing. Okay I can show you over here so we have isa Alma look as Marco Ricardo Rossi software Thomas 24 year all done fine thank you.

Is there anyone whose name is not found because I updated the list yesterday so hopefully everybody's name should be there now in the list. Yeah my name my name isn't there I'm in section B with Mr. Martin Adam yes okay section B welcome your name is not there.

What's your full name Adam or maybe I'll add it later. Yeah okay yeah you have entered right that your your name is not in the list yeah yeah I've entered it there okay sure I'll do that. Okay so let's get back to the class so bullion algebra rules to simplify so let's have a look at some of the bullion expression theorems which are actually used to reduce the bullion expression so I was going through one website.

Simplification of bullion expressions yeah that's fun minimizing bullion expressions so there are certain laws which are used to to minimize the bullion expressions.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

Still there is not much of clarity from the IB side as to what kind of laws you need to learn because there are there are number of laws. So the last update I got was that students need to just learn how to apply these bullion expression simplification laws and if there is any question about simplification then the law will be given to you in the question paper. That's what has been told to us so far it hasn't come in written form but then that's what they told us that if there is any question related to simplification of bullion algebra and if that requires this particular law then that will be given with the question.

Okay so but however if you practice this for couple of problems I think you will automatically get familiar with what are the different laws and how to apply them. So let's have a look at these laws one by one the first one is identity law which says does any variable multiplied with one is that variable itself. What does that mean what does that mean when we say a.1 is always a.

So it's a and true is always a yeah correct so if we have if we have the first law a.1 is always is always a because it will depend on the value of a if a is 0 then 0.1 is 0 and if a is 1 then 1.1 is 1. So 8.1 is always 1 the next law is null law whenever we multiply the input with 0 the output will always be 0. That's the second law 8.0 is 0 that's a null value it doesn't matter what the value of a is because when you multiply that by 0 it will turn out to be it will turn out to be.

8.0 equal to 0 yeah correct and so that's a null law and when you add as for the null law if you add a plus 0 what will be the output always. So 8.a plus 1 a plus 1 will always be one irrespective of the value of a with the way a 0 or a is 1 the output with always be 1. So remember this law 8.0 this is generally used in the simplification if you end up finding an expression which has 8.0 you can consider that to be 0 and if it is a plus 1 that will always be 1.

The third one item pretend law which is a dot a equal to a a dot a will always be equal to a depending on the value of a if a 0 output will be always 0 if a is 1 output will always be 1 and a plus a is also always a. So if both a's are 0 I mean if a 0 obviously 0 plus 0 is 0 and when a is 1 then 1 plus 1 is 1 that's item pretend law. Again in case if there are any questions which may require this law that will be given to you in the question paper but it's always a good idea to remember them.

Then complement law complement is the opposite so a dot a bar is always 0 why is it so. It's our one of them should be 0 and so if so a can have two possible values either 0 or 1 when a is 0 then the opposite of 0 is 1 so 0 dot 1 is 0 and when a is already 1 then 1 times 0 is again 0 so the complement law says that when a is multiplied by a bar the output will always be 0. And a plus a bar will always be 1 so if a 0 a bar will be 1 so 0 plus 1 is 1 and if a is 1 then 1 plus 0 is again 1 that's complement law.

Then domination law a dot 0 equal to 0 and a plus 1 equal to 1 which you also saw here double negation law this is again important double negation is basically the complement of complement of a variable. So if a then 2 bars that's a double complement law if a was 0 0 will become 1 and 1 will again become 0 so that's a complement law a dot a bar equal to 0 sorry double complement law a double bar equal to a so if a was 0 0 will become 1 and 1 will again become 0 so whatever was a will be the output of double complement. Distributive law this is most important for the from the simplification simplification point of view a dot b plus c equal to a dot b plus a dot c so if you end up getting an expression which is a dot b plus b dot c you can apply this distributive law which is take b as common and in the bracket you have a plus c.

So when you have a value in the bracket and multiplied by another variable outside you can open it up by simply using mathematical role a dot b plus a dot c. So it's a simple question so bracket one. The the simplification is from bracket one to the non bracket one this will be useful you know in itself it is not simplifying actually but you when you will have combination of many different expressions within the same Boolean expression and when you open the brackets.

It may make another relationship with the other parts of the expression and ultimately it will be simplified. Okay the next one is very very important demorgans and you can definitely expect a question from demorgans law because that's what subject guide also says there is no specific mentioning of any law but it does mention about demorgans law. What does demorgans law state according to demorgans there are two two laws of demorgans the first law states that a dot b whole bar equal to a bar plus b bar.

This is the first law of demorgans theorem and the second one is a plus b whole bar equal to a bar dot b bar. We must easily simplify this with the truth table let's try and see if the first law works so for doing that we can take. We can take a b zero zero one one zero one zero one a dot b whole bar will be so a dot b zero so this becomes one this also becomes one this becomes one this becomes zero that is a dot b whole bar.

Now let's find out a bar plus b bar so a bar is opposite of a that is one one zero zero b bar is opposite of b which is one zero one zero. And adding them together let's call it C so C will become one one one zero now this output. And this output they are same so that mean that proves the first law of demorgans this is very very important and you can definitely expect a question from the demorgans theorem.

In the sample paper also that we have further IBDP exam IBDP computer science sample paper that has a question based on demorgans theorem. But again if there is a question you will be given that expression of demorgans in the exam but it's always good idea to remember that. So these are two laws of demorgans which are used in the Boolean simplification.

Then we have absorption law a dot a plus b is very simple you can see here we have a dot a dot a plus b a dot a plus b. According to absorption law a dot a plus a dot b right so it turns out into a dot a plus a dot b and this equals to a can somebody tell how this is leading to a. So if a zero yeah and the result of zero times something will be always zero always zero here and if it is one no matter of b it's always be one always be one absolutely so depending on the value of a whatever is the value of a will be the final output.

So if a zero if a is zero then anything multiplied by zero no matter what we have at this part will always be zero so which is a and if a is one if a is one then one multiplied by one plus b so this will always be one and this is already one dot one so which is again a. So that is absorption law so if you ever come across a situation where your Boolean expression turns out to be like this you can just consider it as a a dot a plus b is always a. Complementation law a dot a bar is always zero and a plus a bar is always one and then consensus theorem which is a b plus a bar c plus b c I don't think this is important from your point of view but just remember a b plus a bar c plus b c equal to a b plus a bar c but I don't think this will ever be else in the exam from the examination point of view I can tell you the laws which are important one is this absorption law.

One is de Morgan's law this is the most important distributive law double negation so these all are important except the last one. Now let's have a look at this example simplification of the Boolean function a b plus a c whole bar plus a b bar c this is too long of an expression you won't have such a complex one you will generally have a simple one but anyway you can have a look at this as to how the simplification has happened. So what they have done is since this is de Morgan's theorem can we apply can we apply de Morgan's theorem here a c whole bar yes yes so that will become a bar plus c bar applying the de Morgan's theorem plus a b bar c and then we have opened this up so dot a b so this as open bracket has been opened and then which law is applied here.

Which law is this a dot b c which is this one a dot b plus c ok distributive law so that law has been applied here to get a b bar c dot a b and plus a b bar dot c c and then this is a b a bar plus c bar why is this zero. Why is this turned into zero it's b bar b bar times b b bar times b and what law is applied here b bar dot b is zero this one complementation law b bar dot b equal to zero so that law has been applied here which means b bar dot b become zero and zero multiplied by anything is zero. So this the whole thing turns out to be a zero plus a b bar c next a b c plus a b c bar plus a bar plus c bar plus a b c bar c and then they have mentioned why it has led to this expression right.

So if you're finding it too complex I mean it can be little too overwhelming for you at this stage but honestly you won't get questions which are so difficult it will be maximum two terms and that to be the relationship or the Boolean expression will be quite visible sorry the theorem will be quite visible from that expression as to what expression can be applied so at the most it will be something like this where you can easily make a relationship. So these kind of simplifications I think will prepare a list of you I B style of questions of the simplification and share with you you can try them to simplify using these laws.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Okay now moving on to the next topic which is this one K map and algebraic simplification to simplify output expressions has anyone studied K maps yet. Yes okay yes okay so what what have you studied so far about came up what is came up.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

Well it's a visual representation table like visual representation that allows to simplify Boolean expressions yes basically by grouping there are two methods and you group either once or zeros but I think we are relying more on once in grouping. Right correct so see when you're designing the digital circuitry it is always a desire that we should be able to simplify the Boolean expression to the least extent possible that will not only that will not only reduce the overall size of your digital circuitry but it will also cost you less. So if you have a long Boolean expression of let's say four different terms if somehow we can reduce that to maybe two terms so obviously your cost will be reduced and your size will also be reduced and that is what is called simplification of Boolean expressions.

Now one methods of the Boolean expression simplification is how you saw using the Boolean laws right that is one of the ways of simplifying the Boolean expressions but sometimes they are not very effective especially when the Boolean expression is very long. It may be very time consuming and sometimes you may not be able to efficiently apply all the laws in order to get the least possible. I mean to get the Boolean expression simplifies to lowest level sometimes you may not even be sure that what you have got is actually the smallest form of the given Boolean expression right so came up is a more simplified way of reducing the Boolean expression or simplifying the Boolean expression.

Using the visual method where you don't have to apply any Boolean law so without applying Boolean laws you will still be able to simplify the Boolean expressions okay now let's have a look at the example as to how we can do that.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

This is a very nice video which I will share the link with you which is very nicely explaining the concept of K maps but let's see a few examples here if I can replicate that here.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Now there can be a K map which is either two variables or a K map which can be of three variables that is in your course.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

It can be four variables it can be five variables any number of variables but in your course you have between two and three variables K maps only okay now in K map what we do is let's talk about the two variable K map first.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

We have a square and since it is a two variable K map so we draw a line here the first variable is a and the second variable is B and then we divide this square into four different boxes because there are four different combinations between A and B.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

The first value here could be zero the second value could be one here the first value could be zero and the first value could be one and if you want to write the values just intersect them together so this is zero zero so this is zero this is zero one so one this is one this one is one and zero that is two and this is one and one three these are the mid values for each of the cells in the K map. Have you got how we got zero one two and three in the boxes here the this is the intersection this is the intersection this is the intersection and this is the intersection so zero zero is zero zero zero one is one one zero is two and one one is three and that is how we have got the four different combinations.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

We are just trying to make out all possible inputs and what would be the corresponding output because it's a it's a two variable K map isn't it so how many combinations can be there between A and B it can be zero zero it can be zero zero right it can be zero one it can be one zero and it can be one one.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

The same representation what we saw in the truth table is now being plotted into a K map format so we have taken a yeah sorry say again so we are indexing each combination exactly we are indexing each combination in the visual format. And how we have done it that across this line we have taken A on one side and B on the other side and the two possible values for B could be zero one and two possible values for A could be zero one and if you intersect these values you will get the mid value these are called mid values for each of the cells so zero zero zero zero zero one is one one is two here and one one is sorry one zero is two and one one is three.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

This will be the combination which will be used any K map of two inputs it will change slightly in the three input that we will talk about but right now let's focus on two input K map okay now. Once we have done this let me think about a expression one second do I have any examples. This is a new thing which is added was never the in the previous course so I'm also kind of trying to learn this came up but anyway I can just pick up some examples and explain it to you.

Let's give you a moment. Is there a link in the document I think I have put the link to. Yeah, I see.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Martin have you done K map before. I'm also learning that actually yeah. I'm just trying to look for a video which I saw this afternoon it was really very good.

Okay let me share my screen again with a video. Let me know if you can hear the voice.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

It is required to implement that function is it audible yes yes example let's say we have this Boolean expression and we want to implement it using the logic gates now this expression is in the canonical SOP form so to implement this expression we require three and gates and one or a gate. And here we are assuming that the inputs in the true form and the complemented form are readily available but if we just minimize this expression then we can reduce the number of logic gates which is required to implement this function so in this way by simplifying the Boolean expression we can reduce the number of logic gates and after the minimization. Let's jump to the two variables there are total four different combinations for the two variables there are total four main terms so this is how the two variable came up will look like so here the digit beside each row is the possible value of the a while the digit above each column is the possible values of the B and the combination of this a and B is represented by the each cell of this kind of map.

For in other words we can say that the each cell of this map represents the particular mean term so whenever this a and b are zero then it represents the a bar dot b bar and it is represented by this cell. Similarly, when this a is zero and b is one then it represents the a bar dot b and the second cell represents the mean term m1 likewise when a is one and b is zero and that represents the mean term m2 and this last cell represents the mean term m3 that means each cell of the map represents the particular mean term. And for simplicity we can also denote each cell in the number so here the numbers on the L so this is how the two variable came up will look like similarly now any question from this so far although we will come back to this once again but are you clear with the plotting of two variable came up we haven't yet simplified the expressions but we are just trying to put the possible values of zeros and once between a and b.

So a on the left side b on the right side the possible combination is the question is it is it is it is it and this is see there are two ways that the came ups are presented one is called some of products and product of sums so this is some of product. This is not and or or gate this is just a way of simplifying a Boolean expression which is done in two different forms this form what we are looking at on the screen right now is called some of product which is called SOP form and similarly there's another one which is called product of sum and the whole objective of a Boolean expression is to reduce the expressions to the most simplified form for example if this was an expression which was given to you. And you are asked to simplify this Boolean expression to the least possible combinations then one of the methods is to use the laws of Boolean algebra what we saw in the previous section which can be little complicated because at times we are not even sure if the expression that we have got is the most simplified one and at the same time you have to remember the laws of the Boolean algebra.

There is a better method which is called the came up which can actually be used more conveniently to simplify the Boolean expression to the least possible manner without applying the laws of Boolean algebra and this is what basically we are doing by using this came up representation where we have two variables like this example is three the expression which is given here is actually three variables right the format of and the structure of three variable came up would be slightly different. But then what we are starting going to study first is the two variable came up so you see here the actual expression in this case was the actual expression was this A dot B dot C plus A bar dot B dot C bar plus A dot B bar dot C and after its simplification it turned down to be this which is much shorter than the previous one right this work can easily be used. We have done using the concept of came up but this one has three variables obviously that will be covered in the next part but let's start with looking at how the two variable came up work.

So the very first thing you need to see is that since it is a two variables so we have taken A and B and here we are taking zero zero one as one combination and zero one as the other combination now by looking at the intersection. So this is zero one which is zero zero and the Boolean binary equivalent for zero zero is zero so this first cell will be zero the second one is zero for A and one for B so zero one in decimal is one numeric one. Now coming to the third one that is A is one and B is one so that becomes three one and one is three sorry sorry the third one the white box which is here that is one and zero.

One for A and zero for B so one zero makes it two so the value of this M2 will be two and the last cell on the bottom right is one and one which is three so that is why the values here you can see zero one two and three. This is how the and these are called the min terms as to what is the value for each cell through the various combinations of zeros and months and later you will see how this concept can be used to simplify the Boolean expressions in order to get the most simplified version of the given Boolean expression. This is a plotting of two variables similarly we can have a three variable came up where obviously the number of combinations will increase.

So first let's have a look at that and then we will see how we can use this to simplify look like similarly now let us see the three variable came up so for the three variables okay now here you can see that in the three variable came up we are starting a and a is fine because a single variable so we have taken a on one side and BC on the other side it could also be AB on one side and see on the other side but then that will become vertical here we have two rows in that case we will. In that case we will have three rows if we take AB on one and see on other but the universal representation most of the books or most most of the websites that you will see will be a on one side and BC on the other side by doesn't stop you from taking AB on one side and see on the other side just the structure will change but the final outcome will be same. So going by A and BC A on one side and BC on other side the possible values of A is zero and one because it's a single variable but the possible values of B and C is zero zero B zero C zero zero one where B zero and C is one one one where B is one and C is one and final one one zero where B is one and C is zero do you see something unusual here.

So the index index is the index yes yes which one so it's not if not zero one it's zero one zero one three sorry say again your voice is breaking what is the unusual thing you see here. So the order correct correct so let's have a look at the min term values little later if you look at the possible combinations of zeros and ones here for BC is going zero zero zero one one one and one zero right don't you think one one should have come in the end and one zero over here that would be the right order right zero zero zero one one zero and one one. That should have been the correct order isn't it yes or no the question is if you look at the possible combinations of B and C okay how do we generally take it we take it as ideally we should have taken it as zero zero like B zero C zero second one is zero one and then one zero and then one one to get it zero one two three.

As the min term one correct but there is a reason why one one has been taken before one zero and this is a universal principle which will be applied in all possible cases.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

If you go in the simple order of zero zero zero one one zero one one that will not be able to help you to simplify the Boolean expressions and the reason for taking this particular sequence is for a simple reason that when you move between the adjacent cells.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

In K map there is a great significance of adjacent cells what is adjacent cell adjacent cell is the very next cell from the current cell value.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So if I am on this first top left cell which is zero min term value zero what's the adjacent cell for zero one and one and four one and four so the cell which is very next to the current cell they are called adjacent cells.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So for this zero the adjacent cells are one which is the second one and bottom one for these two are adjacent cells similarly for three the adjacent cells are two on the right side one on the left side and seven down below right.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Now as per the principle between the adjacent cell cells you should not ideally have more than one it changing. Okay this may sound little confusing but let's try to see through the example.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Within the adjacent cells you should have maximum one bit changing if there are two or more bits changing then that will not help you to plot the expressions in the most simplified way. Let's see the example if we take at the zero min term okay. When we go from zero to one how many bits are changing if you look at the combination of zero it is zero zero zero right yeah zero B zero C is zero.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So the possible combinations of ABC is zero zero zero and for the second adjacent cell which is one what is the value zero zero one two. Sorry zero zero zero zero zero zero one how many bits are changing between the two one one only one only one bit is changing. So this is fine now let's have a look at one two three.

Okay how many bits are changing from one two three what's the combination of one zero zero one isn't it. Yeah yeah and what is the combination for three zero one one zero one one zero one one how many bits are changing between zero zero one and zero one one one. One bit one bit one bit no let's replace one zero with one one with one zero let's let's try and take one zero over here instead of one one.

How many bits are changing between one and two. From zero zero one to zero one zero how many bits are changing.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

So as soon as you get a condition where two bits are changing then your simplification law is not going to work here.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

That's why the placements of zeros and once is done in such a way that for every adjacent cell the maximum number of bits change should be maximum one. Okay now to simplify things for others who have not been able to understand this or follow this just remember it that you have to take this combination. Always take this combination whenever you have to simplify using the de Morgan's theorem zero zero zero one one one and one zero on the top and zero one to the left that is the combination if you take this combination no further justification needed.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Okay there are two from that means if you move from the one column to the so that's what this guy has talked about is changing that means these two corner cells are also adjacent.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Okay one more thing what could be what are the adjacent cells for let's say two.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

For the minimum for the mint for the cell having momentum value two so you said one adjacent value is three and one is six.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Any other any other adjacent cells for two zero zero. Why zero. Are they not far from one another zero and two.

No no no no. I can hear myself with the service. There's some interference here and so I cannot properly properly.

No we can hear you we can hear you properly are you able to hear me.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Okay no problem so you you said zero is also adjacent cell for two I'm not saying it's wrong but can you tell me why. I cannot say I'm sorry.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Okay no problem see the adjacent cells are not only those which are adjacent to one another for example for five the adjacent cells is one seven and four but if you look at the last cells extreme ends and if you wrap let's say it is on a paper and when you wrap that paper in a circular manner. Okay right now it's a it's a flat paper but when you wrap them and make a circle then obviously this two will be joined with zero isn't it. So you're looking at the paper in a flat format but if you wrap it okay if you make it circular then obviously this two just like a word map what we see is a what we see is a flat surface but the globe is not like that when you.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

When you join the globe in the circular manner two extreme ends actually go and join with each other so therefore for for two the adjacent cells are not just three and six but it's also zero.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Right so please remember that the adjacent cells are not just the extreme adjacent I mean not just the immediate adjacent but also the extreme ends so for two.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Only these third bit is so for two the adjacent cell is even zero for six the adjacent cell is four right changing and you can apply that rule even here that the bits which are changing between adjacent cells are two extreme ends they're also only one bit is changing so any property any combination where just one bit is changing between two cells that becomes an adjacent cell.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Like take the example of zero and two how many bits are changing between zero and two zero is what zero zero zero and what is two zero one zero zero one zero how many bits are changing one big one big one bit so that means they are also adjacent cells for any other combination it will not be one bit for example six and five if you see it will not be just one bit changing but minimum two bits will be changing so they are not adjacent cell.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So the property of adjacent coming back to the main definition the property of an adjacent cell is not that what you see adjacent to each cell it's actually any two cells where the number of bits which is changing between them is maximum one and that applies to the corner or the extreme ends of the came up.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So adjacent cells are not that your I see as adjacent it's any two cell combinations where the change in number of bits between the two is one that makes it adjacent cell that is the universal definition for adjacent cell likewise as we move from the same map and in this video what we will do whatever mean terms are present in and also be given as a bar dot B bar plus a bar dot B bar.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Okay now this is one sample one this is one example where since I said it's a sum of product form so you can see here sigma sum of product SOP we will do POS also in the next lesson but right now we are just focusing on a SOP and I have to check that you have I think only SOP in your syllabus but I'll confirm and I'll let you know so some of product you can see here that the question will be given either in this form F1 equal to sigma zero one three. What is zero one three signify this signifies that the momentum values of this to variable K math is one at these momentum values so zero one and three so zero is turned into one one is turned into one and three is turned into one what is left is zero that zero has been kept aside.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Please try to see this and ask me question if you are not clear one form of K map which is given to you in the exams or in the questions would be sigma zero one three where zero one three represents the momentum cells or indexes where the value is one. So look at zero four plus one plus three yeah correct so zero so that mean the momentum value is have Do you guys also have this interference, like the repeating sound? Yeah, I have them too.

I think it's just because when he was screaming and showing his screen, it's probably because he was Wi-Fi or something. Maybe. Yeah, but it's complicated.

Let's see. Yeah, I think when he was sharing his screen, he was sharing his audio too. I can take over.

I can see you guys.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So we're talking about K-maps, so K-maps, it's like a great thingy, I guess. It's like once and zero's on top or something. Wait, where is Mr.

Martin? Is he also gone? I'm Mr.

Martin now. I think so, yeah. That's awesome.

No, wait, could this new Mr. Martin? Okay, proceed.

Proceed. We need them. Yeah, please proceed.

Educate us. Educate us. Okay, guys.

So K, uh, K. Wait, can I tell me? K, what is it?

K, K something.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION



## K-maps. Exactly.



## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Yeah, K-maps is derived from the word K-pop, right? So K-pop has like a long history of K-pop.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

And like, so if you watch like, you know, shows like K-pop, Demon Hamters, K-maps come out all the time. You know, we're like the ones and zero's. They represent like the characters, you know?

And like, and then you hear you have like one character and then like this another character.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION



## And yeah, K-maps basically big. That's so smart. That's so interesting.


We don't need to write this down. It's deep. It's deep.

It's deep.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

K-maps, it's, it's just a deep topic. This is going to be on the class recording as well. Is this techno people or whatever?

I'd be curriculum. All the people who couldn't join this class. Well, this is beyond the examples.

Use. Let's try this again. We're on.

Okay. So what's actually going on because like is the. Let's go.

Yeah. Do it just way in where this can go. I want to go to see man.

Is way our day. way too late. Wait until like five minutes.

Okay. Overall, how are you guys? How are you taking CS?

I mean, it's okay, at least it's not as hard as my physics or math too. I mean, it's okay, at least it's not as hard as my physics and my math, because I'm taking math, E, H, L, and physics, E, L. Same here.

My physics doesn't teach. We got tested on three topics. We never learn.

Oh my god. Oh, for me, my math teacher is good. He teaches my physics, each other.

Yeah, yeah, like, I think it's physics teaching as a whole. My math teacher is great. It's just keeping up.

It's physics teachers as a whole that struggle at teaching. Wait, is everybody here like taking physics and maths? Any visual arts students?

No, okay. I mean, I would have loved to take visual arts, but I can't take visual arts as well. Oh, you do?

Yeah. That's cool. And what do you study at visual arts?

What do we study? We just like, in like the new service, they gave us a new service, they put it for 27 graduates. Yeah, they change the syllabus.

And then like, you can basically do anything you want. And like, in my case, I'm doing a lot of like 3D artworks and they kind of stuff, but like, yeah, it's just like, you're as a touch designer, right? Yes, I am a designer.

Touchers, I know. Yeah, I've seen your comments. Can you show you?

Hello. Hello. Hi, no problem.

Just continue, continue talking to yourselves. Sorry, I got disconnected. All right.

So, okay, let me share my screen again. Is Mr. Martin also not there?

Yeah, he's also not here. He's not here. Okay, fine.

Okay, so we were here. So, somebody's microphone is on. Could you turn it off?

Okay. Now, we were here.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, you can see here that we, one of the formats that you may get is F1 equal to sigma 013. So, what you will do is you will just plot the cells, which whose values are given there. So, 013 is given.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, look at the minterm value, which contributes to 013. The first one is 0, the second one. I can see the screen share.

It's easier than loading. Okay, one second. One second.

Can you see now? I just got back. Yeah, yes, sure.

Can you see the screen now? No, no. No, perhaps we need to refine the page.

It will help. Still not visible? No.

Now, I can see. Now, I can see. Okay.

I don't know if I turn on the sound also or not. Let me check again. Share the time with sound.

Yeah. Now, I can see, right? I can.

Sorry. Nothing on my. Not yet.

I think you need to rejoin. So, yeah, after I rejoined, I could see it. How many of you can't see?

Like, is it majority or just one or two? I also can see. Yeah, I can see.

Does it work if you refresh the page? Yes, after I refresh the page, it worked. Okay, just refresh your page.

Maybe it will work then. Please confirm so that I will continue them. Nice.

It's Sean. Yeah. Is it showing for all now?

Yeah, after I refresh is waking up. I also refresh my page and I can see. Okay, perfect.

Okay. So, these are the two different formats that you may get question on, but most likely it will be on the second format where you will be given the expression, which is a bar dot b bar plus a bar dot b plus a dot b. Now, as the first step, what you need to do is you have to mark all those major cells whose expressions are given to you.

For example, when a is zero, that would be actually be a bar and when b is zero, that is considered as b bar. When b is one, that is b and when a is one, that is taken as one. Now, when I say a bar dot b bar, which of these minimum values do you think is most applicable?

Hey, bar and b bar. Yeah, a bar and b bar, which minimum value will you index as one? Index zero.

The index zero, the index zero, the first top left that cell will be marked as one because a zero, that means a bar and b zero, which is b bar. That is the first step. Then comes a bar dot b, which cell do you think is a bar dot b?

What is the value of a index one? Zero and the value of b is one, that means index one. So, that is greater as one.

Then we have a and b, that means a should also be one and b should also be one, which is this the third index value. So, as a first step, you have to mark all the cells which are one, one, one, right?


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

So, either you can be directly given those minimum values like sigma zero, one, three, which is straightforward or otherwise, they may give you the Boolean expression with either bar or without bar. So, you see which cells would be applicable. That is the first step.

If you have done this correctly, that means the chances are that you will be able to simplify the expression in the most convenient way. Now, what is the objective here? The objective is to simplify a bar dot b bar plus a bar dot b plus a dot b to the simplest form possible.

One of the methods could be using the Boolean laws.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

But right now we are doing using the K map where you don't have to use any of the Boolean laws. So, this is the first step that you have plotted all the index values wherever applicable.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

The next one is to make a pair of ones of the adjacent cells. That is the second step. Okay.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Now, I am saying that you have to pair all the ones which are adjacent to one another. So, which will be the pairs you can recreate from index zero from index zero to one and one correct.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, the first index will be zero and one because they are adjacent cells and both are one one. So, we will index that first. What is the second pair that you can make?

Two. You know, one index three. Very good, index one and index three.

Yes. So, first index. So, you have to only pick up the ones just disregard zero.

So, when we are picking up the ones, we will make the pair of zero and one that is first pair and the second pair is one and three. As you can see, let me scroll further. Yeah.

So, this is the first pair which is one index zero and index one. So, which means A bar dot B bar plus A bar dot B. B is equal to one.

That means this A bar dot B bar plus A bar dot B is equal to A bar. So, by grouping these two ones, equivalently, we will get A bar. So, now, let us see how to get the same result from the A map.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

Now, on the left side, you can see that they have used the laws of Boolean algebra to simplify. So, A bar dot B bar plus A bar dot B, they have used one law. A bar has been common.

B bar plus B. What is B bar plus B? That is always one.

Right? One of the laws said that if we add B plus B bar, that will always be one and one dot any value is always that value. So, we are left with A bar.

That is to the simplification using the Boolean laws.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Now, let us see how we can get the same output using the K map. So, from the first pair that we have created, where we have made a pair of minimum value zero and minimum value one. Now, we will get the values in such a way that we will be left with only the value A bar and how that happens?


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

When you do the pairing, whether it's a two variable K map or three variable K map, when you do the pairing, you have to see that which value is remaining constant and which values are changing. So, we have two variables here. One is A and one is B.

For both these values of the pair is A changing or A remaining zero for both of them. A is zero for both of them because it is horizontal. So, whether you look at A from the zero min term or you look at A from one min term, the value of A stays zero.

That means the A is constant, isn't it? Now, what is A actually? A is zero and if A is zero, that means it will be represented by the variable A bar, isn't it?

If A is zero, that means A will be represented as A bar. How about is B staying same in both the cells or is it changing? It's changing.

B is zero in the first one and B is becoming one in the second one. So, if any variable whose value is changing between the given two, we just completely disregard that.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, which means when you have done the pairing, we are looking for the two variables as to which is changing and which is not changing. If something is not changing, that is retained and something which is changing, that will be disregarded. Since A is remaining zero in both these, so A will remain as zero because it's not changing.

So, we will retain A but B is zero here and it becomes one there. So, it is changing. So, we will completely disregard B.

Now, we will not write A because the value of A is actually zero which is a representation of A bar. So, therefore, from this pair, we just get A bar. Have you got this?

Have you understood how we are getting A bar? Yes, first, here that we created which is index zero and index one, A remains same because we are talking about this horizontal line for both the cells A is zero. It's not changing.

Anything which is not changing, we will retain that. So, therefore, A will be written as A bar because it's a zero. If it was one, if we were on the lower row, then it would be A because A is one there.

But since we are in the upper row which is zero, so it will be taken as A bar. But B is changing in the first cell it is zero, in the second cell it is one which is changing. So, we will not take B, we will remove it.

So, the only thing we are left with in the first case is A bar. Now, based on this, what is the second pair we can make? Index number one and three.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

Now, if we make one and three, can you tell me what will be the simplified Boolean expression for between one and three? What is changing and what is remaining constant? Peace.

Is A remaining constant? No. No.

Because in the first row, A is zero, in the second row, A is one. So, we will completely disregard A. What are we left with?

B. B, B. Now, will B, B, B or B bar plus B?

Because B is represented by the value one. So, which means the B will be taken as one. So, the simplified expression will be A bar plus B.

And that is the simplified expression for this whole expression which is given here. So, let us see that. So, if you see this group, then this dot B and A B.

So, if you simplify this expression using the Boolean laws, then we will get the B. And the same result, we can also get directly from the A map. So, if you see this group, then in this group, the variable A is changing while the variable B is constant.

So, in this group, we will keep this variable B. And we will ignore this variable A. And here, since the value of B is equal to one.

So, this group represents B. That means this group represents A bar while this group represents B. And the overall function is the summation of A bar and B.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, in this way, using the K map, we can simplify the Boolean expression without using any Boolean laws.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

You saw how much simplification we did from use of two gates for A bar. Sorry, A bar 1 gate, B bar 1 gate, A bar and B, two other gates and A and B. So, a Boolean expression which comprise of six different variables is now, six different combinations is now turn to just A bar plus B.

And if you draw the truth table for this longer version of the Boolean expression, which is given in F 1 there. And this shorter version, which is A bar plus B, they both will actually exactly be the same in terms of the output. So, when you are making a digital circuitry, and you derive an expression that this expression will give you the desired output, which is through A bar dot B bar plus A bar dot B plus A dot B.

Your next target should be to simplify this to see, look at the possibility of reducing this expression to a least possible way, still to get the same output. So, if your expectation was this output, the same can be achieved using the smaller version, which is A bar plus B. And you see how simply we were able to simplify the Boolean expression without using any laws of the Boolean algebra.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, again to repeat, first of all whichever format is given to you, whether sigma 013 or A bar B bar A bar B AB, you have to first come up with the indexes whose value will be 1. Next step, you have to look at the possible combinations of the pairs of the edges and cells. Once you have done these two things, then keep the variable, which is remaining constant for the two indexes of the pair, and disregard the one which is changing.

Like in the first case, A bar in the second case B, and then add them together, it is sum of products SOP. So, it will be A bar plus B, that is the reduced expression. Let us have a look at the next example.

Okay, in this case, the expression is A bar dot B plus A dot B bar. Can this be simplified for the? Am I still connected?

And I think you can be simplified further. Yeah, it cannot be.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION



## Do we have any adjacent cells where the pairing can be done? No. No.


No.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

So, if that is the scenario, when you don't see any possibility of a pairing, because there are no two adjacent cells, which can be paired in such a scenario, the further simplification cannot be done, which means the Boolean expression, which is given to you, that is the simplest form. You cannot go anything beyond that. Isn't that XOR gate?

A bar dot B plus A B bar, yes, that is an XOR gate, correct? Okay, yeah. But in case of this, you cannot further simplify.

So, you have to get this A bar dot B plus A dot B bar.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Now, let us have a look at the three variable K map. The concept is exactly the same. It will be just the plotting of values, which will slightly change.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, the values, which are given to us here is sigma 015. Okay. So, as a part of this, what we have done is we have marked all those min term values as one whose values are given here.

For example, 0. This min term 1, m 0, m 1 and m 5. And now, let us try to minimize this function.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, as I have discussed earlier, to minimize this function, we need to make the group of ones, which are adjacent to each other, and the group should be in the power of 2. So, in this case, this is the first group. And by comparing these two ones, we will get the second group.

And with these two groups, all the ones in the map gets covered. So, first of all, let us consider this group. So, in this group, if you see, then this variable C is changing, while the variable A and B are fixed.

Therefore, for this particular group, we will consider this variable A and B, and we will ignore the variable C. Now, see the difference here, because we have three variables here, A, B and C. Unlike the previous case, where we were just looking at the values of A or B in isolation.

Now, we are also looking at the value of C. Now, if we see the first pair, which is between index 0 and index 1, the only value which is remaining same between A, B and C is 0. So, sorry, between A and B, because A is 0, B is 0 in both the cases.

So, that means, A and B will be retained, and C will be disregarded, because C is changing from 0 to 1. In the first case, we have the value of C 0, and the value of, in the first case, the value of C 0, and in the second case, value of C is 1. So, that needs to be disregarded.

What are we left with for this pair?


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

What do you think will be the Boolean expression for this one? A bar? Is it A bar?

And what about B? B is also not changing, right? Yes, because B is also not changing, so it will be A bar dot B bar.

The actual expression for this would have been the previously. Can you tell me what was the original expression for this, which we are trying to reduce? What was the original expression?

A bar, B bar, C bar, A bar, B bar, C bar, C. The original expression was A bar, B bar, C bar, because all 0, 0, 0, and for the second cell, it was A bar, B bar, C, which is now being reduced to A bar dot B bar, because we are considering the values which are staying constant, which is A, B, C is changing, so we will disregard C. Moreover, since the value of A and B is 0, that means this group represents A bar dot B bar.

Similarly, let us see the second group. What do you think will be the expression for this one? Second one?

What is changing and what is, is A changing or not? A is changing and? No, A is not changing, it will be B bar dot C.

But A is changing now? A is changing from 0 to 1. 0, 0, 1 and 1, 0, 1.

So, it is not A changing, because A is 0 here and A is 1 here. Think about it. See, the first expression is 0, 0, 1 and the second one is 1, 1.

0, 1. So, A is changing, how about B? Not changing.

B is not changing and C? Not changing. In the variable A is changing, while the variable B and C are same.

So, for a column, the 0 and 1 stays the same, like in the previous case, the row was same, so A was not changing.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

But when you make a pairing of a column, both the values of column remains 0, 1 for both the pairs. Like when you look at index 1, then also BC is 0, 1. When you look at index 5, then also BC is 0, 1.

So, BC is not changing, but A is changing between the two. And therefore, the expression for this will be B bar C. So, here the B is 0, while C is 1.

Therefore, this group represents B bar dot C. And if you see the oral function, and the oral function is equal to A bar dot B bar plus B bar dot C.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

So, the expression which was earlier four different expressions is now turned down to two, which is the most simplest form without using any Boolean expression. This is the second case. Let's look at one more case.

This one. Now, here you will learn one thing new.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

How many pairs do you think can be made here, can be made here of the adjacent cells? Three. Okay.

Anyone else? Anyone else?


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION



## How many pairs can we make of the adjacent?



## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION



## Which are the adjacent cells to 0? Two pairs. Okay.


So, we have two answers so far. One is three and one is two. It's quite easy to see that Y 3 came up, because yes, three pairs can be made 0, 1, 1, 5 and 5, 7.

And there's a reason why there can be only two. Can you tell me it's observe Y 2? Well, yeah, why would we overlap?

There is no need to overlap. We can create two pairs, and they will suffice correctly. When you make the pair, you have to also see that have we covered all the ones.

If we have already covered the ones, then you don't have to redo that.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

Like, for example, when you do the pairing of 0 and 1, and next you do the pairing of 5 and 7, have we covered all four ones at least once? Yes. If that is done, then you don't really have to overlap once again.

Although, if you overlap, you will have one extra expression. It will still be simplified, but not to the lowest level.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

If you apply Boolean law into that new expression, you will still be able to further reduce it.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

But if you are doing it from K-MAP, or at a effort should be that without using any laws of Boolean algebra, we should be able to get the minimum possible expression, which could give the same output. So, therefore, always remember that if all the ones are already covered, then you don't have to overlap anything, which means 0, 1 can be one pair, and 5 and 7 could be another pair. In that sentence, you will be able to get the expression, which will be the most simplest one, which represents this main term thing.

So, in this group, the value of EN... Okay, let's derive this. What do you think will be the output for the first pair, which is index 0 and 1?

What is changing and what is remaining constant? It is not changing. It is not changing and C is changing.

So, what will be the expression for the first one? A bar B bar? A bar and B bar.

Perfect. And how about the second pair? A bar C?

No, A C. What is changing? A is not changing.

P is changing. P is changing and C is not changing. So, which means since A is 1, so it will be A and C is 1, which will be C.

So, A bar dot B bar plus A dot C. While the variable C is changing, A bar dot B bar. The value of ENB is 0.

That means this group represents A bar dot D bar. Similarly, in this second group, the variable ANC is not changing, while this variable B is changing. So, in this group, the value of ANC is equal to 1.

Therefore, this group represents A dot C. So, if you see the overall minimized function and that is equal to A bar dot B bar plus A C. Now, some of you might have a question that can we combine this and then map?

Okay, can you try solving one problem now?


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION



## Let's say we have the value sigma 0, 2, 5, 7. Can you solve that?



## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION



## Just use a pen and a paper and take the sigma value as 0, 2, 5, 7.



## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

Tell me the simplified Boolean expression. 0, 2, 5, 7. You can write your answers in the chart.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

0, 2, 5, 7 is the sigma value.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

0, 2, 5, 7 is the sigma value of N. The class will end in just about 5 minutes. So, this is the last problem that I'm giving.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

After this, we will create one assignment sheet for you based on KMAP, because I don't think in Pamoja assignments, we have anything to do with KMAPs there. So, we'll create a problem statement which you can solve and we'll let you know how to submit that. Well, for some reason, the chart is disabled for me, but I can sell, yes, for me for the very least.

Can you try it now? It's still disabled. That's very surprising.

Okay, tell me the answer. Well, for me, it was a c a a dot c plus a bar dot c bar plus a bar dot c bar dot not c. Okay, I put it in the chart.

Can you see the chart at least? Can you all see the chart or not? Yes, yes, yes.

Okay, so I have it. Please check your answers with this. So, what software got was a a dot c plus a bar dot c bar.

Is it all of you get it? I got three terms. You got three three different expressions.

So, three terms. Tell me your answer, Namo. So, a bar b bar plus a bar plus b bar.

So, a bar b bar plus b bar b bar c bar. How did you get plus in between a bar plus b bar? No, just a bar times b bar.

The first one is a bar dot b bar then plus b bar dot c bar plus b bar dot c bar then plus a b c bar a b c bar. This is what you have got. No, that's not correct.

No, that's not correct. So, I'll say number was zero two five seven. The number was zero two.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

That means two adjacent corners else. So, if you wrap them together, you that will make one pair, right? So, zero two was one and five seven.

So, five. So, only two pairs will be there. One is two extreme ends and one is five and seven.

I did say indexing wrong. I think you did the indexing wrong. That's why we are I'm emphasizing that your first step is indexing and if you make a mistake in the indexing, that definitely you're going to be getting a zero marks in this question.

So, it's always zero one three two zero one three two. How about others Ricardo? You got answer.

Ricardo, Thomas, Sarah. Did anyone try and got any answer? It's okay, even if you did a mistake, no problem.

But let me know if you got the answer. Okay, is the chart still not accessible to you? Can you still not access the chart?

Yeah, I do kind of access the charts. But why? Students can chat with teachers.

Do you want me to reset all the charts? One second. Can you try now?

Is it working for you? Yeah, no, it's working. Okay, so now I'm not asking for the answer right now.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

Can you just say whether you have understood how we are simplifying Boolean expression using KMAP or not? So, say yes, if you have understood or say no, if you have not understood. It's okay.

I mean, it's a complex thing as both Mr Martin and I said, we are also learning with you. So, it's not easy, but at least did you learn the concept? Yes, somewhat, not really.

Okay, now I got the correct answer. Sarah got no. Okay, somewhat.

Fine. So, we will do one thing. I mean, this recording will be available to you and that YouTube video which I just played, I will share that.

Let me share that right now. In fact, I will link that to the document, which is there in the PDF format, but let me also share it here so that you can keep this for yourself and watch it once again. It's a very good video because I also learned from this only today.

So, you can use this video to just go through it once again and our recording is also available. I mean, it will be available in the same folder.


## K-MAPS (KARNAUGH MAPS) - SIMPLIFICATION

So, watch through this and next week, we will start with a few assignments on KMAP just to look at what we learned today and then we will continue from there. But just before you live, just let's have a look at what is covered in the week number six so that we can actually start working on that as well. And one more important thing I wanted to share with you, just give me a moment.

So, essentially, we are done with a 1.2.5 up to a 1.2.5. Can you see my screen? Yes, yes.

Okay. So, essentially, we have done up to a 1.2.5.


## CLOSING REMARKS & NEXT WEEK PREVIEW

Now, next week is operating system and control systems, which is again very, very theoretical topic. So, this should take one lesson and then this translation only is for HL and then we are done with this topic. So, next week, we will finish this a 1.3, which is operating systems.


## BOOLEAN ALGEBRA RULES & LAWS

But before that, we will have a look at the KMAP again and maybe we will take up some examples of Boolean simplification. What we will do is I will create a worksheet for you where I will give you some Boolean expression simplification, few logic gate diagrams and few truth table problems. So, try to solve that over the week time.


## CLOSING REMARKS & NEXT WEEK PREVIEW

Next week, when we come, we will just start with that discussion and then we will get on to this. I also shared with you one of the links of one website for the programming practice. So, if you look into your email that you may have received or the announcements I think, you will see that I have shared one link with you, which is actually a self-taught tutorial for the programming.

So, for those who are new to Java programming, because very soon we will be starting with the theme B, computational thinkin. I strongly recommend that you start learning a little bit of programming using that link. It has step-by-step lessons like starting from most fundamental concepts of what variables are, what literals are, what is decision-making statement, what is looping statement.

It's a very good tutorial and there is a space where you can actually type your program and execute it on the same page. So, start learning that for those especially who are new to programming, because once we start the programming, we will have to follow a certain pace. And if you don't know programming at all, then you will be struggling a little bit.

So, it's my stronger advice that please start learning programming right from now. So, that by the time we start, you will already be familiar with it. Okay.

Yes, Sarah, have a question. Where can I find the topic list that you had opened? Have you recently joined Sarah?

Yeah, I joined yesterday. Yeah, I know. So, you're new.

So, Mr. Martin will be meeting you. Martin, have you fixed up appointment with Sarah already?

I schedule some meetings for today earlier before our meeting and for tomorrow. So, Sarah, you can look at the announcements. I saw the link, but my name isn't on there and there's no option for me to put like, my name isn't listed.

So, I can't really. Okay. So, we need to add her name today.

Okay. Let me, let me add you to that list. Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. I've already added Sarah to the attendance list.

So, probably that's why she's here. But you're one meeting, maybe you can add it there or maybe just, maybe you'll have to meet Sarah individually, because she may have to be explained the catch-up plan for everything that we have done so far. Sarah, is it help?

Yeah. Okay. So, Sarah, we have a folder whose link will be shared with you.

Martin who will tell you what all we have covered and where you can find that content list. Okay. He will also create a weekly plan for you so that week one, you can cover during the next week, then week two, then week three and week four.

And simultaneously, you will also be covering with whatever is going on with the current classes. Okay. And is there any like assignments?

I have to submit now. Yeah. There are some assignments.

So, you will do that week by week. So, week one assignment, you will finish over the next one week. So, week five plus week one, you will finish together.

The next week, you will finish week two and week six like that. Okay. Right.

All right, guys. Thank you so much for staying here. I know it's a little confusing topic, but by next week, I'm sure that we will have a lot more clarity.
