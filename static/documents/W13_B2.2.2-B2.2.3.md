Activity: Evaluating Criterion A Samples in Groups

You will work in groups of five to evaluate two IA Criterion A examples.


## 1. Form groups and open the document

○ Your teacher will assign you to a breakout room.

○ One person in the group opens this document and makes a copy for the group:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fph1LKZMnHGNvolP7b4erjEmRL7XwyzK

XVMi70sTdPQ/edit?usp=sharing


## 2. Share screen and read together

○ The same person should share their screen in the breakout room.

○ As a group, read Example 1 and Example 2 slowly and discuss what you notice.


## 3. Use the checklist and rubric

○ For each example, work through the checklist in the document.

○ Discuss every statement and tick the check box as Met or Not met based on the

text.

○ Using the rubric in the document, agree on the mark out of 4 that you think each

example deserves for Criterion A and type that mark in the space provided, with

a short reason if you can.


## 4. Return and share

○ When we return from breakout rooms, your group will briefly share:

■ The mark you gave each example

■ One strength and one weakness you noticed for each example

Total time for this activity: 20 minutes

(About 3–4 minutes to set up, 6–7 minutes per example, and 3–4 minutes to prepare what you

will share.)

## 1. B2.3.3 Construct programs that utilize looping structures

1.1 What is a loop

A loop is a control structure that allows a program to repeat a block of code several times.

In Java there are three common loop structures:

• for

• while

• do while

The syllabus expects you to understand:

• Types of loops, including counted loops and conditional loops, and when each is appropriate

• How to place conditional statements inside loops that use Boolean and relational operators to

control behaviour

You should be able to:

• Read and trace existing loops

• Construct your own loops to solve simple problems

• Recognize infinite loops and avoid them

1.2 Counted loops in Java the for loop

A counted loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat an

action.

1.2.1 General form

for (initialization; condition; update) {

// statements to repeat

}

Order of execution:


## 1. Initialization runs once at the beginning


---
*Page 3*


## 2. Condition is checked

## 3. If condition is true, the body runs

## 4. Update runs

## 5. Go back to step 2

1.2.2 Example 1 sum of the first five natural numbers

public class SumFirstFive {

public static void main(String[] args) {

int sum = 0;

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {

sum = sum + i;

}

System.out.println("Sum is " + sum);

}

}

Explanation:

• i is the loop counter

• The loop starts at i = 1

• As long as i <= 5 is true, the body executes

• In each iteration, sum is increased by the current value of i

• At the end, sum equals 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5

Trace table:


---
*Page 4*

Iteration i before test Condition i <= 5 sum before sum after i after update

1 1 true 0 1 2

2 2 true 1 3 3

3 3 true 3 6 4

4 4 true 6 10 5

5 5 true 10 15 6

6 6 false 15 15 stop

Appropriate uses of counted loops:

• Repeating a task a fixed number of times

• Traversing arrays and ArrayLists from index zero to the last index

1.3 Conditional loops while and do while

Conditional loops are used when you do not know exactly how many repetitions are needed.

Instead, you keep repeating while a condition is true.

1.3.1 The while loop

General form:

while (condition) {

// statements to repeat

}


---
*Page 5*

The body may run zero times or many times.

The condition is checked at the top of the loop.

Example 2 input validation with a while loop

import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputValidation {

public static void main(String[] args) {

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int number = -1;

while (number < 0 || number > 10) {

System.out.print("Enter a number from 0 to 10: ");

number = sc.nextInt();

}

System.out.println("You entered: " + number);

sc.close();

}

}

Key ideas:

• The condition uses relational operators < and >

• The condition also uses Boolean operator || which means logical OR

• The loop repeats while the number is outside the allowed range


---
*Page 6*

Trace table for user inputs 20, 11, 5:

Loop number Condition (number < 0 or User number after Loop

pass before test number > 10) enters input continues

1 minus 1 true 20 20 yes

2 20 true 11 11 yes

3 11 true 5 5 yes

4 5 false no input 5 no

Appropriate uses of a while loop:

• Repeat until input becomes valid

• Repeat until a sentinel value is entered

• Repeat until a computation reaches a certain state

1.3.2 The do while loop

General form:

do {

// statements

} while (condition);

The difference from while is that the body always runs at least once.

The condition is checked at the bottom.

Example 3 simple menu with do while

import java.util.Scanner;


---
*Page 7*

public class MenuExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int choice;

do {

System.out.println("1. Say Hello");

System.out.println("2. Say Goodbye");

System.out.println("3. Exit");

System.out.print("Enter choice: ");

choice = sc.nextInt();

if (choice == 1) {

System.out.println("Hello");

} else if (choice == 2) {

System.out.println("Goodbye");

} else if (choice != 3) {

System.out.println("Invalid choice");

}

} while (choice != 3);


---
*Page 8*

sc.close();

}

}

Here you see:

• A conditional loop that repeats until choice equals 3

• Conditional statements inside the loop with relational operators == and !=

• Use of if, else if, and else to control what happens in each repetition

1.4 Nested loops

A nested loop is a loop inside another loop.

Every time the outer loop runs once, the inner loop runs through all its iterations.

Nested loops are very common when working with tables, grids, or two dimensional arrays.

1.4.1 Concept of nested loops

Think of nested loops as:

• Outer loop controls rows

• Inner loop controls columns

or

• Outer loop controls days

• Inner loop controls hours

1.4.2 Example 4 multiplication table using nested for loops

public class MultiplicationTable {

public static void main(String[] args) {

for (int row = 1; row <= 3; row++) {

for (int col = 1; col <= 3; col++) {


---
*Page 9*

int product = row * col;

System.out.print(product + " ");

}

System.out.println();

}

}

}

Output:

1 2 3

2 4 6

3 6 9

Explanation:

• Outer loop variable row goes from 1 to 3

• For each row, inner loop variable col goes from 1 to 3

• For each pair (row, col), we compute row * col and print it


---
*Page 10*

High level trace of loop structure:

row col values executed Printed values

1 1, 2, 3 1 2 3

2 1, 2, 3 2 4 6

3 1, 2, 3 3 6 9

1.4.3 Nested loops with conditions inside

You can place if statements inside nested loops.

This allows you to create patterns or selectively process elements.

Example 5 diagonal pattern with stars and dots

public class DiagonalPattern {

public static void main(String[] args) {

int size = 4;

for (int row = 0; row < size; row++) {

for (int col = 0; col < size; col++) {

if (row == col) {

System.out.print("* ");

} else {

System.out.print(". ");

}


---
*Page 11*

}

System.out.println();

}

}

}

Here:

• The condition row == col uses a relational operator

• When row equals col, a star is printed

• Otherwise a dot is printed

• The outer loop controls which row you are in

• The inner loop controls the column in that row

1.5 Using while loops for numeric processing extracting digits

A classic pattern is to use a while loop to extract digits from a number.

1.5.1 Example 6 print digits of a number from last to first

public class ExtractDigits {

public static void main(String[] args) {

int number = 4725;

while (number > 0) {

int digit = number % 10;

System.out.println(digit);

number = number / 10;

}


---
*Page 12*

}

}

Explanation:

• Condition number > 0 is a relational test

• number % 10 gives the last digit of the number

• number / 10 removes the last digit

• The loop continues until number becomes zero

Trace table:

Loop pass number before digit = number % 10 number after division Printed digit

1 4725 5 472 5

2 472 2 47 2

3 47 7 4 7

4 4 4 0 4

5 0 loop ends

This shows a conditional loop in action with arithmetic and relational operators.


## 2. B2.2.2 Construct programs that apply arrays and ArrayLists

The syllabus requires you to understand:

• One dimensional arrays in Java

• Two dimensional arrays in Java


---
*Page 13*

• ArrayList in Java as a dynamic list

• How to add, remove and traverse elements in a dynamic list

Everything in this section will use Java.

2.1 One dimensional arrays in Java

2.1.1 Concept

An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in a fixed sequence.

A one dimensional array is like a row of boxes, each box containing a value.

Properties:

• Fixed length once created

• Elements are accessed using an integer index

• Indexes start at zero and go up to length minus one

2.1.2 Declaring, creating and initializing

Declare and create an array with a specific size:

int[] scores = new int[5]; // 5 integers, all initialized to 0

Array literal with initial values:

int[] scores = {80, 92, 75, 60, 88};

2.1.3 Traversing a one dimensional array

To process each element, you usually use a counted for loop.

Example 7 printing all scores

public class ArrayTraverse {

public static void main(String[] args) {

int[] scores = {80, 92, 75, 60, 88};


---
*Page 14*

for (int i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {

System.out.println("Score " + i + " is " + scores[i]);

}

}

}

Explanation:

• scores.length gives the number of elements

• The loop iterates from i = 0 to i = scores.length minus 1

• scores[i] accesses the element at index i

Traversing arrays is directly linked to the idea of counted loops from B2.3.3.

2.2 Two dimensional arrays in Java

2.2.1 Concept

A two dimensional array can be thought of as a table of values with rows and columns.

Visual example:

1 2 3

4 5 6

This can be stored as int[][] grid.

2.2.2 Declaring and initializing a 2D array

Example with values:

int[][] grid = {


---
*Page 15*

{1, 2, 3},

{4, 5, 6}

};

• grid.length is the number of rows

• grid[row].length is the number of columns in that row

2.2.3 Traversing a 2D array with nested loops

Example 8 printing a 2D array

public class TwoDArrayExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {

int[][] grid = {

{1, 2, 3},

{4, 5, 6}

};

for (int row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {

for (int col = 0; col < grid[row].length; col++) {

System.out.print(grid[row][col] + " ");

}

System.out.println();

}

}

}


---
*Page 16*

Explanation:

• The outer loop goes through each row

• The inner loop goes through each column in the current row

• This is a perfect example of nested loops from B2.3.3 used together with arrays from B2.2.2

2.3 ArrayList in Java a dynamic list

2.3.1 Concept

An ArrayList is a class in the Java Collections framework. It behaves like a resizable array.

Differences from arrays:

• Size can grow and shrink at run time

• Methods are used to add and remove elements

• You can store objects, usually with a type parameter such as ArrayList<String>

2.3.2 Creating an ArrayList

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListCreate {

public static void main(String[] args) {

ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

names.add("Alice");

names.add("Bob");

names.add("Charlie");

System.out.println(names);


---
*Page 17*

}

}

Here:

• ArrayList<String> is a list that will store strings

• add appends a new element at the end

2.3.3 Traversing an ArrayList

Indexed traversal:

for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {

System.out.println("Name " + i + ": " + names.get(i));

}

Enhanced for loop:

for (String name : names) {

System.out.println(name);

}

Both methods are important at IB level.

2.3.4 Adding and removing elements

Adding:

names.add("Dana"); // add at the end

names.add(1, "Ethan"); // insert at index 1

Removing:


---
*Page 18*

names.remove("Bob"); // remove first occurrence of "Bob"

names.remove(0); // remove element at index 0

Dynamic behaviour:

• After insertion or removal, the list automatically adjusts

• You do not need to manage the size manually as with arrays

Example 9 working with an ArrayList

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListExample {

public static void main(String[] args) {

ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();

names.add("Alice");

names.add("Bob");

names.add("Charlie");

System.out.println("Initial list: " + names);

names.add(1, "Dana");

System.out.println("After inserting Dana: " + names);

names.remove("Bob");


---
*Page 19*

System.out.println("After removing Bob: " + names);

System.out.println("Traversing list:");

for (String name : names) {

System.out.println(name);

}

}

}

This example demonstrates:

• How a dynamic list grows

• How an element can be inserted in the middle

• How an element can be removed

• How to traverse all elements
