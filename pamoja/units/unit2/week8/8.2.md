# Build a Problem Specification: Recycling Hub Scheduler

## Learning Objectives
- Apply specification concepts to a real scenario
- Construct a full specification with justification
- Reflect on how components connect

---

## Scenario: Community Recycling Hub Scheduler
Manual booking causes congestion and conflicts. Build a lightweight system for residents to self-schedule drop‑offs and for staff to manage bookings.

## Your Task
Create a complete problem specification including:

### 1) Problem Statement
- Core problem, stakeholders (residents, staff), and context.

### 2) Constraints and Limitations
- Technical, financial, user, legal; devices, connectivity, training, software preferences.

### 3) Objectives and Goals
- Functional objectives; measurable goals (SMART) for responsiveness, usability, throughput.

### 4) Input and Output Specifications
- Inputs: exact fields, formats, sources, timing.
- Outputs: schedules, confirmations, reminders; formats/timing.

### 5) Evaluation Criteria
- Usability, speed, accuracy, reliability, compliance.

Support tips:
- Reference bakery/clinic templates from Lesson 8.1
- Draft sections separately, peer review, use the checklist

Self‑evaluation checklist (abbrev.): clear problem; ≥3 constraints; aligned objectives; SMART goals; precise I/O; comprehensive evaluation; precise, unambiguous language; logical cohesion; readable to outsiders.

## Optional Extension
Propose 2–3 stretch features (e.g., auto‑reminders, contactless check‑in, recyclable category guidance) and justify benefits.

---

## Conclusion
Treat this as real pre‑project planning: clarity now enables effective design, testing, and evaluation later.
