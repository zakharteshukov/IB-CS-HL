# Problem Specifications: Purpose, Components, and Examples

## Learning Objectives
- Understand problem specifications in computational thinking
- Describe components: problem statement; constraints; objectives/goals; input/output; evaluation criteria
- Analyse how specifications drive successful software

---

## Why Specifications Matter
A clear specification aligns stakeholders, avoids ambiguity, and sets testable expectations. It is the “blueprint” for design, implementation, testing, and evaluation.

## Components of a Problem Specification

### a) Problem Statement
- What is the issue?
- Who is affected?
- Why does it matter?

Examples (accordion in source): local bakery; healthcare clinic.

### b) Constraints and Limitations
- Technical, user, legal/ethical, budget/time
Examples highlight usability needs, device limits, privacy compliance, and offline capability.

### c) Objectives and Goals
- Objectives: required features/functions
- Goals: performance/usability targets (use SMART)
Examples include dashboards, confirmations, response time constraints.

### d) Input and Output Specifications
- Inputs: fields, types, sources
- Outputs: reports, notifications, timing
Examples list customer/patient fields and daily schedules/notifications.

### e) Evaluation Criteria
- Accuracy, speed, user satisfaction, compliance, reliability
Examples: unique appointments, reminder timing, responsiveness.
