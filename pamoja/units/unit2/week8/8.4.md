# Applying Computational Thinking to a Real Scenario

## Learning Objectives
- Use abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and algorithmic design together
- Document and justify reasoning at each stage

---

## Scenario: Organizing a School Coding Hackathon
Handle five tasks: registration; team allocation; venue/schedule; mentorship/judging; final awards.

We provide a model for Registration; complete one other task using the four‑column framework.

## Model: Registration of Participants

| Concept | What to Consider | Scenario Examples | Example Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Abstraction | What details can be ignored? What core information matters? | Ignore decorative preferences/long bios; focus on name, grade, contact, dietary needs | Ask only for name, grade, emergency contact, team preference; simple form |
| Decomposition | What smaller tasks make the process? | Form design; data collection; verification; confirmation; deadline tracking | Design form → share link/QR → collect → verify → confirm via email |
| Pattern Recognition | What similar school processes exist? | Club sign‑ups; fair registrations | Use Google Forms + filters; avoid open‑ended inputs |
| Algorithmic Design | What step sequence ensures smooth execution? | Form creation → promotion → collection → sorting → confirmation | 1) Create form 2) Share 3) Track 4) Sort to sheet/DB 5) Send confirmations |
