# Computational Thinking: Four Foundational Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Define abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic design
- Identify real‑life and computing examples
- See how these interact in structured problem‑solving

---

## Overview
Computational thinking breaks complex problems into simpler parts, filters details, spots patterns, and designs procedures. It’s cross‑disciplinary and underpins modern computing.

---

## 1) Abstraction
Definition: focus on essentials; hide irrelevant detail.
- Simple: metro map shows lines/stations, not terrain.
- Computing: login UI hides encryption/DB/query details; developers use functions/APIs without low‑level internals.

## 2) Decomposition
Definition: split a complex task into manageable parts.
- Simple: party planning → venue, invites, catering, entertainment, decor, RSVPs.
- Computing: game dev split into graphics, input, audio, logic, networking.

## 3) Pattern Recognition
Definition: identify similarities/trends to generalize solutions.
- Simple: commute traffic peaks → adjust route/time.
- Computing: spam detection via recurring keywords/behavior.

## 4) Algorithmic Design
Definition: create clear, efficient, step‑by‑step instructions.
- Simple: a recipe with ordered steps and ingredients.
- Computing: compute average score → sum, count, divide; consider time/space.

## Activity: Identify the Concept
Match each statement to a concept and explain briefly:
- “Remove the background noise from this dataset.”
- “Break the website project into frontend, backend, and database.”
- “Notice that all failed logins have a similar timestamp pattern.”
- “Describe how a vending machine returns change in the fewest coins.”
