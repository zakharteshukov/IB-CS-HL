# Multitasking, Resource Allocation, and Deadlocks (OS)

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how the OS manages multitasking
- Describe OS resource allocation
- Identify challenges: scheduling, contention, deadlock

---

## Multitasking and Resource Allocation
The OS executes multiple processes by allocating CPU time, memory, and I/O fairly and efficiently.

---

## Task Scheduling
- FCFS: simple, can cause long waits
- SJN: minimizes average wait, requires knowing burst time
- Round Robin: fixed time slice, fair but more context switches
- Priority: highest first; prevent starvation with aging

Scheduling ensures no single process monopolizes the CPU.

---

## Resource Contention
When processes need the same resource:
- Mutual exclusion (critical sections)
- Semaphores/locks (binary and counting)
- I/O management (buffering, spooling, prioritization)

---

## Deadlock
Occurs if all four hold: mutual exclusion, hold-and-wait, no preemption, circular wait.

Management strategies:
- Prevention: break a condition (e.g., resource ordering)
- Detection: wait‑for graph, Banker's safe-state checks
- Recovery: terminate/rollback, preempt resources

---

## Conclusion
Effective OS scheduling, contention handling, and deadlock control keep systems responsive and stable.

## Activities
1) Process scheduling (FCFS, SJN, RR q=4): compute order, turnaround, Gantt charts; compare average wait times.
2) Resource allocation (CPU/RAM/I/O for P1–P4): use Banker's Algorithm to test safe state; propose an allocation to avoid contention/deadlock.
