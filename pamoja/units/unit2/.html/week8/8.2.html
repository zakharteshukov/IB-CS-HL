        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p><span data-contrast="auto">In the previous lesson, you explored what a problem specification is and how each
                component contributes to the success of a computational solution. You examined how a well-defined
                specification helps align user needs with technical feasibility and sets the foundation for clear
                design, testing, and evaluation.</span><span

        </p>
        <p><span data-contrast="auto">In this lesson, you will apply that knowledge by constructing a full problem
                specification for a given scenario. This exercise simulates a real-world development situation where you
                must think critically and systematically. It is also designed to build your readiness for the Internal
                Assessment (IA), where writing a strong, comprehensive, and testable specification is essential. By
                engaging in this activity, you will not only deepen your conceptual understanding but also practice an
                important skill that underpins much of the project-based work in the IB Computer Science
                course.</span><span

        <p><span data-contrast="auto">You are approached by a local environmental non-profit that manages a community
                recycling hub serving several neighbourhoods. The hub sees a steady increase in residents bringing
                recyclables—ranging from plastics and electronics to large household items. With no digital system in
                place, appointments are booked using handwritten logs or informal phone calls.</span><span

        </p>
        <p><span data-contrast="auto">This manual process often results in residents arriving at the same time, causing
                confusion, extended wait times, and unnecessary congestion at the site. Staff find it difficult to
                maintain an accurate schedule and are spending excessive time resolving booking conflicts and managing

        <p><span data-contrast="auto">The organisation is seeking a lightweight digital solution that will allow
                residents to self-schedule recycling drop-offs in available time slots. It should also enable staff to

        <p><span data-contrast="auto">As an extension activity, I would like you to think creatively about how your
                solution could go a step further. Propose two to three features that go beyond the core scheduling
                function. These could include things like auto-reminder notifications, contactless check-in options, or
                categorizing recyclables to optimize sorting.</span><span

        </p>
        <p><span data-contrast="auto">When doing so, make sure to briefly explain why each proposed feature could be
                beneficial. Consider how it would help users (residents or staff), improve efficiency, or contribute to
                environmental goals. You don’t need to implement these features, but showing that you can think beyond
                the minimum requirements is a valuable skill in system design.</span><span

        <h4>Conclusion&nbsp;</h4>
        <p><span data-contrast="auto">This task bridges theoretical understanding and real-world application. Writing an
                effective problem specification now will give you a practical edge in preparing your IA and tackling
                future software design tasks, particularly where you must meet client needs through structured analysis
                and careful planning.</span><span

        </p>
        <p><span data-contrast="auto">This is more than just an academic exercise—it reflects the same process
                professional developers follow when planning real software projects. The ability to construct a
                well-structured specification can help you communicate your ideas clearly, reduce misunderstandings with
                clients or users, and serve as a solid foundation for your design and testing stages.</span><span

        </p>
        <p><span data-contrast="auto">Treat this as both a challenge and a rehearsal for the kind of critical thinking
                and planning you will need as you progress through this course and beyond.</span><span
