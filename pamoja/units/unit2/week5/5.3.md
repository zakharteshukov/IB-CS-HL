# Boolean Algebra and Circuit Optimization; Combining Gates

## Learning Objectives
- Combine multiple logic gates to perform complex logical operations in circuits.
- Apply Boolean algebra to simplify logic diagrams/expressions for efficient implementation.

## Boolean Algebra and Circuit Optimization
Boolean algebra simplifies logical expressions to reduce gate count, power, and complexity while maintaining behavior.

### Fundamental Boolean Rules

| Rule | Expression | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | A AND 1 = A; A OR 0 = A | Leaves variable unchanged |
| Null | A AND 0 = 0; A OR 1 = 1 | Dominant input determines result |
| Idempotent | A AND A = A; A OR A = A | Eliminates redundant terms |
| Inverse | A AND NOT A = 0; A OR NOT A = 1 | Cancels opposing inputs |
| Commutative | A AND B = B AND A; A OR B = B OR A | Order irrelevant |
| Associative | (A AND B) AND C = A AND (B AND C) | Grouping irrelevant |
| Distributive | A AND (B OR C) = (A AND B) OR (A AND C) | Expands expressions |
| De Morgan’s | NOT (A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B) | AND↔OR conversion |
| Absorption | A OR (A AND B) = A | Removes redundant terms |

### Simplification Examples
- F = A OR (A AND B) → F = A (Absorption)
- F = (A AND B) OR (A AND NOT B) → A AND (B OR NOT B) = A AND 1 = A
- F = (A OR B) AND (A OR NOT B) → A OR (B AND NOT B) = A
- F = A AND (B OR C) + A AND (NOT B OR C)
  - = A AND ((B OR C) OR (NOT B OR C)) = A AND (C OR B OR NOT B)
  - = A AND (C OR 1) = A

## Real-World Example: Sensor-Based Lighting
Light ON = Motion Detected OR Manual Switch ON

## Key Points to Remember
- Boolean algebra reduces circuit complexity and cost.
- Rules eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency.
- Fewer gates reduce power and increase speed.

---

## Combining Logic Gates
Complex circuits use multiple gates (AND/OR/NOT/NAND/NOR/XOR/XNOR). Process:
1) Identify inputs and required outputs.
2) Implement with gates.
3) Validate with a truth table.
4) Optimize using Boolean algebra.

### Example: Traffic Signal System
Green = (NOT Pedestrian) AND (Timer Expired OR Emergency)

Truth table headings: P, T, E, Green

## Logic Optimization Example
X = (A AND B) OR (A AND NOT B) OR (B AND C)

Simplify:
1) (A AND B) OR (A AND NOT B) = A
2) X = A OR (B AND C)

K-map idea (A,B vs C): Optimize to minimal form where appropriate.
