## Truth Tables
A truth table is a fundamental tool used in digital logic to predict the output of simple logic circuits based on given inputs. Logic circuits are made up of logic gates, which process binary inputs (0s and 1s) to produce a binary output according to Boolean logic. Each gate follows a unique logical operation, and truth tables help visualize how different input combinations affect the output.

To construct a truth table, we list all possible input combinations and systematically apply the logic operation associated with the gate or circuit in question. The number of rows in a truth table is determined by the number of inputs, following the formula 2ⁿ, where n is the number of inputs.

## Order of Hierarchy in Boolean Expressions
When analyzing logic circuits, understanding the order in which operations are executed is crucial. Boolean algebra follows a specific order of operations, similar to arithmetic operations:
1. Parentheses – Operations inside parentheses are evaluated first.
2. NOT (¬) Operations – Negation is applied before any other operation.
3. AND (∧) Operations – Conjunction is performed next, combining input values.
4. OR (∨) Operations – Disjunction is evaluated last.

For example, consider the Boolean expression:
- A AND (B OR C) AND NOT D

This will be evaluated in the following order:
1. Evaluate the parentheses first: (B OR C)
2. Apply the NOT operation: NOT D
3. Perform the AND operations in sequence:
   - First: A AND (result from step 1)
   - Then: (result from step 2) AND (result from previous step)

### A AND (B OR C) AND NOT D
The evaluation order is:
1. (B OR C)
2. NOT D
3. A AND (B OR C)
4. Final Output = (A AND (B OR C)) AND (NOT D)

| A | B | C | D | (B OR C) | NOT D | A AND (B OR C) | Output |
|---|---|---|---|----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

## Predicting the Output of Simple Logic Circuits Using Truth Tables
Logic gates process inputs according to predefined rules. The truth table helps determine the output for every possible input combination. Consider a basic AND gate, which outputs 1 (true) only when both inputs are 1. A truth table for a two-input AND gate looks like this:

| Input A | Input B | Output (A AND B) |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| 0       | 0       | 0                 |
| 0       | 1       | 0                 |
| 1       | 0       | 0                 |
| 1       | 1       | 1                 |

## Real-World Examples of Truth Tables in Action

### Traffic Light Control Systems
Traffic lights use logic circuits to determine when lights should change based on sensor inputs. An AND gate can ensure that the green light only turns on if no pedestrian button is pressed and no vehicle is detected in the opposing lane.

### Password-Enabled Digital Locks
Electronic locks use AND gates to verify passwords. If the correct four-digit code is entered, the system checks each digit through an AND logic check. Only when all conditions are satisfied (all digits match) does the lock open.

### Elevator Control Systems
Elevators use OR and AND gates to check whether the call button has been pressed and whether the elevator is available. If both conditions are met, the elevator moves to the requested floor.

### Home Security Alarm Systems
Alarm systems use NAND and NOR gates to determine if an unauthorized entry has occurred. If a door sensor detects motion while the security system is active, an alarm is triggered.
