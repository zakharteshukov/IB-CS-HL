# Logic Diagrams and Circuit Analysis

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Interpret and construct logic diagrams to show how logic gates connect and interact.
- Use standard symbols for AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates in circuit design.
- Analyze inputs diagrammatically to determine corresponding circuit outputs.

## Understanding Logic Diagrams in Digital Circuits
Logic diagrams are graphical representations of how logic gates interact.

Components of a logic diagram:
- Inputs (A, B, C, …): Binary signals (0 or 1).
- Logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.
- Connections (wires): Indicate data flow.
- Output (X, Y, …): Final processed result.

## Standard Gate Symbols in Logic Design

| Logic Gate | Symbol | Boolean Expression | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| AND | ∧ | A AND B | 1 if both inputs are 1 |
| OR | ∨ | A OR B | 1 if at least one input is 1 |
| NOT | ¬ | NOT A | Inverts the input |
| NAND | ⊼ | NOT (A AND B) | 0 only if both inputs are 1 |
| NOR | ⊽ | NOT (A OR B) | 1 only if both inputs are 0 |
| XOR | ⊕ | A XOR B | 1 if inputs are different |
| XNOR | ⊙ | A XNOR B | 1 if inputs are the same |

## Example: Constructing a Logic Circuit
Given: X = (A AND B) OR (A AND NOT B)

Steps:
1) Identify gates: AND, OR, NOT.
2) Construct intermediate terms A AND B and A AND NOT B.
3) OR the terms to produce X.
