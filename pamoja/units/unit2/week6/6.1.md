# Operating Systems: Abstraction and Resource Management

## Learning Objective
- Explain how operating systems abstract hardware complexities to manage CPU, memory, storage, and I/O.

---

## What Is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) intermediates between users/apps and hardware, providing process scheduling, memory management, file systems, device drivers, and more to enable efficient, stable multi-program operation.

---

## CPU Management and Process Scheduling
- Scheduling algorithms: Round Robin, FCFS, Priority.
- Time-sharing: divide CPU time among processes for smooth multitasking.
- Context switching: save/restore process state to switch tasks seamlessly.

---

## Memory Management
The OS allocates/deallocates memory safely among processes and supports virtual memory.

### Segmentation (Segmented Memory)
- Programs/data split into variable-sized segments (procedures, stacks, etc.).
- OS tracks start/size of each segment; whole segment is in RAM or not.
- Can cause external fragmentation; compaction may be used.

### Paging (Paged Memory)
- Physical memory split into equal pages; a process spans multiple non-contiguous pages.
- Page table maps logical to physical frames; unused pages swap to disk (virtual memory).
- Heavy swapping can cause thrashing.

## Swapping
Temporarily move a process to secondary storage to free RAM; swap back later to resume.

---

## Operating System Scheduling (Time Slicing)
Reference: `https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_qa2.htm`

Example sequence (time slices) illustrated in the lesson.

---

## Priorities
- Highest priority runs first; ties use FCFS.
- Priority may depend on memory/time/other resource needs.

Real-world example: Smartphone multitasking—OS balances CPU time across foreground and background apps.

---

## Storage Management and File Systems
- Organizes data in NTFS, FAT32, ext4, etc.
- Improves throughput with caching/prefetching; enforces security via permissions/encryption.

Example: Cloud storage abstracts distribution across servers; user just drags/drops files.

---

## I/O Device Management
- Device drivers enable software-hardware communication.
- I/O scheduling and buffering provide fairness/efficiency.

Example: Plug-and-play USB—OS installs/configures driver automatically.

---

## System Resource Allocation and Load Balancing
- Monitor and adjust allocations to avoid bottlenecks.
- Distribute work across CPU cores; conserve energy on mobile.

Example: Cloud platforms balance CPU/memory/bandwidth across VMs.

---

## Summary: Key Points
- OS abstracts hardware and manages CPU, memory, storage, I/O.
- Scheduling enables fair multitasking; memory management isolates processes.
- File systems organize and secure data; drivers handle devices.
- Resource allocation prevents overload; virtualization extends capacity.
