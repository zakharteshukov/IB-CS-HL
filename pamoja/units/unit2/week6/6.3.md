## Why CPU Scheduling Matters
Scheduling determines how processes share CPU time to optimize responsiveness, throughput, and fairness.

## Scheduling Approaches

### First‑Come‑First‑Served (FCFS)
- Non‑preemptive, executes by arrival order; simple, no starvation.
- Drawback: convoy effect; long jobs block short ones.
Real‑world: bank teller queue.

### Round Robin (RR)
- Preemptive; fixed time quantum per process; fair for interactive systems.
- Overhead from context switches; quantum tuning matters.
Real‑world: time‑sharing in online games.

### Multilevel Queue (MLQ)
- Processes categorized into queues (e.g., system/interactive/batch); each with its own policy.
- Improves responsiveness; risk of starvation for low‑priority queues.
Real‑world: air traffic control priorities.

### Priority Scheduling
- Highest priority runs first (preemptive or non‑preemptive); ties via FCFS.
- Risk: starvation; fix with aging.
Real‑world: ER triage.

## Comparison Table (Key Ideas)

| Algorithm | Characteristics | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Applied In |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FCFS | Non‑preemptive; arrival order | Simple; no starvation | High wait if long job first | Batch systems |
| Round Robin | Preemptive; fixed quantum | Fair; responsive | Context switching overhead | Time‑sharing/interactive |
| Multilevel Queue | Separate queues/policies | Separates critical/non‑critical | Possible starvation | Multitasking/real‑time |
| Priority | Priority levels; preempt/non‑preempt | Critical tasks first | Starvation risk; needs aging | Critical/embedded |

---

## Key Points
- Scheduling shares CPU fairly and efficiently.
- Choice depends on workload and latency needs.
- Starvation must be mitigated (e.g., aging in priority/MLQ).
