# Week 4 Lesson 4 — Logic Gates in Binary Computing; Boolean Operators

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of logic gates in binary computing
- Define/apply AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR

## Role of Logic Gates in Binary Computing
- Basic computation: ALU operations (add, subtract, multiply)
- Data storage: flip‑flops (NAND/NOR) in RAM/cache
- Signal processing: process video, audio, text
- CPU control: decode/execute instructions

## Key Points
- Gates implement Boolean logic to process/store data
- Applications: clocks, traffic systems, elevators, security
- Built from transistors in CPUs, memory, embedded systems

## Boolean Operators (Gate Summaries)

### AND
- Output 1 only if both inputs are 1
- Use when multiple conditions must be true (e.g., both sensors OK)

### OR
- Output 1 if any input is 1
- Multiple triggers can activate an event

### NOT
- Inverts input (0→1, 1→0)
- Used for negation/enable‑disable logic

### NAND
- Output 0 only if both inputs are 1 (AND followed by NOT)
- Useful for control and as a universal gate

### NOR
- Output 1 only if both inputs are 0 (OR followed by NOT)
- Universal gate; used in latches/flip‑flops

### XOR
- Output 1 if inputs differ
- Used in adders, parity, simple ciphers

### XNOR
- Output 1 if inputs are equal
- Used in equality checks/identity matching

## Example: Adders
- Half adder uses XOR (sum) and AND (carry)
- Full adder chains half adders for 3 inputs (A, B, Cin)

## Real‑World Applications
- Security systems (AND gates combine biometric checks)
- Traffic control (AND/OR with sensors)
- Automation/Robotics (AND conditions on sensors)
- Cryptography (XOR in enc/dec)
