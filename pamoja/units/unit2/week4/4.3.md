# Week 4 Lesson 3 — Logic Gates: Purpose, Functions, Applications

## Learning Objectives
- Describe purpose and use of logic gates in digital circuits
- Explain functions and applications of logic gates in computer systems

## What Are Logic Gates?
Logic gates are electronic circuits that take binary inputs and produce a binary output per Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). Implemented with transistors inside ICs.

## Why Logic Gates Matter
- Decision‑making (conditions, control flow)
- Data processing and storage (CPU, RAM/ROM)
- Automated control systems (sensors → actions)
- Arithmetic operations (ALU: add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Encryption and security (XOR in ciphers)

## Example Video

## Real‑World Applications
- Digital clocks/timers
- Automatic street lighting with sensors (e.g., NAND)
- Traffic light control (AND/OR)
- Elevators and security systems (AND checks for conditions)
- Digital locks (AND all digits before unlock)
