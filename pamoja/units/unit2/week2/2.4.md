# Week 2 Lesson 4 — Primary Memory, CPU Interaction, and Caches

## Learning Objectives
- Describe RAM, ROM, cache (L1, L2, L3), and registers.
- Explain CPU interaction with different memory types.
- Define and illustrate cache hit and cache miss.

## Introduction
Overview of primary memory types, their roles, and why cache behavior is critical to performance.

## Introduction to Primary Memory
Primary memory stores data/instructions the CPU actively uses; it’s fast, volatile, and smaller than secondary storage.

## Types of Primary Memory

### Random-Access Memory (RAM)
- Purpose: Holds active data and instructions for fast access.
- Characteristics:
  - Volatile (cleared on power-off)
  - Faster than secondary storage
  - Types:
    - Static RAM (SRAM): Very fast; used for cache
    - Dynamic RAM (DRAM): Slower but cost-effective; main system memory

### Read-Only Memory (ROM)
- Purpose: Permanent instructions for boot (BIOS/firmware)
- Characteristics:
  - Non-volatile
  - Typically read-only (some are updatable)
- Types of ROM:
  - Mask ROM (MROM): Pre-programmed at manufacture; not modifiable
  - PROM: Programmable once by user
  - EPROM: Erasable with UV light; reprogrammable
  - EEPROM: Electrically erasable/reprogrammable; multiple cycles
  - Flash: Faster EEPROM; used in SSDs, USBs, memory cards

## CPU–Memory Interaction Hierarchy
1. Registers: Fastest access
2. L1/L2/L3 Caches: Frequently used data
3. RAM: Main working memory
4. ROM: Boot instructions

Efficient hierarchy minimizes CPU stall time and boosts performance.

## Cache Hits and Cache Misses
- Cache Hit: Data found in cache; faster execution.
- Cache Miss: Data not in cache; fetched from RAM or storage; higher latency.

Cache hit rate directly impacts performance in HPC, gaming, and servers.

## Conclusion and Recap
- RAM vs ROM serve different roles.
- Caches and registers speed CPU operations.
- Hierarchical memory improves efficiency.
- Cache hits/misses are key to performance.

## Discussion
Analyze real-world scenarios where cache performance matters (gaming, rendering, servers).
