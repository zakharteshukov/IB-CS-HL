# Week 2 Lesson 3 — CPU vs GPU: Differences and Collaboration

## Learning Objectives
- Explain architectural differences between CPUs and GPUs.
- Evaluate how CPUs and GPUs work together for efficiency.

## Introduction
This lesson explores key differences between CPUs and GPUs and how they collaborate in modern systems.

## Differences Between CPUs and GPUs

### Design Philosophies & Usage
- CPU: General-purpose, complex control flow, strong single-threaded performance.
- GPU: Specialized for parallel computing; ideal for graphics, AI, and simulations.

### Core Architecture & Processing Power
- CPU Architecture: Few powerful cores (2–64), optimized for serial execution and multitasking.
- GPU Architecture: Thousands of smaller cores, optimized for parallel execution.
- Processing Power: CPUs excel at low-latency control-heavy tasks; GPUs excel at massive parallelism.

### Memory Access & Power Efficiency
- CPU Memory: Low-latency caches (L1/L2/L3) for quick decision-making.
- GPU Memory: High-bandwidth memory (VRAM, GDDR, HBM) for throughput.
- Power: GPUs use more power per operation but complete bulk computations faster.

### Summary Table

| Feature | CPU | GPU |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Few powerful cores (2–64) for serial exec | Thousands of cores for parallel exec |
| Processing Power | High single-threaded, logic-heavy ops | High parallel performance |
| Memory Access | Low-latency caches (L1/L2/L3) | High-bandwidth VRAM (GDDR/HBM) |
| Power Efficiency | Lower per-task power | More power-intensive; efficient at scale |
| Best Suited For | OS, general computing, logic-heavy apps | Graphics, AI, simulations, scientific computing |

## How CPUs & GPUs Work Together
- Task Division: CPU orchestrates logic and assigns bulk tasks to GPU.
- Data Sharing: CPU for low-latency decisions; GPU for bulk matrix/array ops.
- Coordinated Execution: CPU preprocessing and I/O; GPU heavy numeric compute.

### Case Study: AI in Self-Driving Cars
- CPU: Decision-making, monitoring, vehicle control.
- GPU: Image recognition, sensor fusion, neural networks.
- Why Both: CPU ensures safety/control; GPU handles real-time vision tasks.

## Interactive Demonstration: Speed Test (Concept)
- Compare matrix multiplication on CPU vs GPU using NumPy/CuPy.

## Reflective Questions
1. How does parallel processing improve performance?
2. Why do we still need CPUs if GPUs are faster?
3. When might a CPU outperform a GPU?
4. How might quantum computing impact GPU roles?
