# Week 2 Lesson 1 — CPU Components and Roles

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
- Describe the functions and interactions of the main CPU components.
- Explain the roles of different registers and buses.
- Differentiate between single-core, multi-core, and co-processors.
- Illustrate the relationship between CPU components using a diagram.

## Introduction
In this lesson, you will learn about the various components of the CPU, different types of processors, and a diagrammatic representation of the relationship between different components of the CPU.

## Computers as a System and the Role of the CPU
Computers operate as integrated systems of hardware and software. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) executes instructions, manages data flow, and coordinates all activities.

- Running software applications
- Processing user inputs
- Managing system resources
- Performing calculations

Modern multi-core CPUs enable parallel processing for better multitasking.

## Main CPU Components

### CPU Units
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Executes arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and logic (AND, OR, NOT) operations; works closely with the accumulator.
- Control Unit (CU): Interprets instructions, issues control signals, and coordinates data flow between CPU and other components.

### CPU Registers
- Instruction Register (IR): Holds the current instruction.
- Program Counter (PC): Address of the next instruction.
- Memory Address Register (MAR): Memory address to read/write.
- Memory Data Register (MDR): Data moving between memory and CPU.
- Accumulator (AC): Intermediate results from ALU operations.

## Buses: Communication Pathways
- Address Bus: Carries memory addresses (unidirectional).
- Data Bus: Transfers actual data (bidirectional).
- Control Bus: Transmits control signals (read/write, interrupts).

## Processors: Types and Performance

| Topic                 | Details                                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single-Core Processor | One processing unit; executes one task at a time; limited multitasking.          |
| Multi-Core Processor  | Multiple cores in one CPU; parallel tasks; improved multitasking and efficiency. |

## Diagrammatic Representation of CPU Components

This diagram illustrates: ALU, CU, registers (IR, PC, MAR, MDR, AC), and buses (address, data, control).

## Key Takeaways
- The CPU consists of ALU, CU, registers, and buses.
- Registers store temporary data/instructions to speed up processing.
- Buses facilitate communication within the CPU.
- Multi-core processors improve performance through parallel execution.
