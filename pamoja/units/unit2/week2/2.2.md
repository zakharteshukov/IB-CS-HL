# Week 2 Lesson 2 — The Role of GPUs

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the role of GPUs in computing (graphics rendering and parallel processing).
- Explain architectural differences between CPUs and GPUs.
- Analyze real-world GPU applications (AI, simulations, gaming).
- Evaluate how CPUs and GPUs work together.

## Introduction
GPUs accelerate parallel workloads, working alongside CPUs to enhance performance in modern computing.

## What is a GPU?
A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized processor designed for highly parallel computations. Beyond rendering, GPUs power machine learning, simulations, and more.

## GPU Architecture & Processing Power
- Parallel Processing: Thousands of small cores process many tasks simultaneously.
- Optimized for Floating-Point Operations: Excellent for physics simulations and deep learning.
- High-Bandwidth Memory (VRAM): Fast memory for large datasets and real-time workloads.

## Real-World Applications of GPUs
- Video Game Rendering: Real-time shading, textures, lighting.
- AI & Machine Learning: Training and inference on large datasets.
- Medical Imaging & Simulations: MRI, CT processing.
- Cryptocurrency Mining: Parallel cryptographic computations.
- Weather & Scientific Simulations: High-speed numerical models.
