# Week 3 Lesson 2 — Secondary Storage: Internal vs External

## Learning Objectives
- Describe and differentiate internal vs external secondary storage.
- Match use cases to appropriate storage types.

## Introduction to Secondary Storage
Secondary storage is non‑volatile and retains data when powered off. It includes internal (built‑in) and external (removable or network) options.

## Internal Storage Devices
### Solid State Drive (SSD)
- Flash memory, no moving parts
- Fast boot and data access; improves overall performance
- Common in modern laptops/desktops (SATA, NVMe, M.2)

### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
- Magnetic spinning platters and moving head
- Large capacity at lower cost; slower than SSDs
- More failure‑prone due to mechanics

### Embedded MultiMedia Card (eMMC)
- Integrated flash in smartphones, tablets, budget laptops
- Moderate speeds; lower cost/power than SSDs

## External Storage Devices
### External SSD
- High‑speed portable storage for fast transfers, gaming, pro apps

### External HDD
- High‑capacity, affordable backups and archives

### Optical Drives (CD/DVD/Blu‑ray)
- Read/write optical media; less common today

### Flash Drives (USB)
- Small, portable, for file transfer and bootable media

### Memory Cards (SD/microSD)
- Expandable storage for cameras and mobile devices

### Network Attached Storage (NAS)
- Centralized networked storage for sharing, remote access, collaboration

## Scenarios and Recommended Storage
| Scenario | Recommended Storage |
|---|---|
| Fast boot/high performance | Internal SSD |
| Large internal capacity, low cost | Internal HDD |
| Mobile/budget devices | eMMC |
| Portable high‑speed external | External SSD |
| Affordable high‑capacity backup | External HDD |
| Archival media/software install | Optical Drive |
| Quick transfer and portability | USB Flash Drive |
| Expandable camera/mobile storage | Memory Card |
| Remote/collaborative sharing | NAS |

## Conclusion
Choose internal vs external solutions based on speed, capacity, durability, portability, and flexibility. Internal drives affect system performance; external expands capacity and backup.
