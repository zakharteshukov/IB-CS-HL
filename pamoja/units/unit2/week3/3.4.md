# Week 3 Lesson 4 — Cloud Services: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS

## Learning Objectives
- Define SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.
- Identify characteristics, advantages, and limitations of each.
- Compare approaches in real‑world scenarios.

## Introduction to Cloud Service Models
Cloud services provide remote compute, storage, and software. SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS differ in control and responsibility.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Definition: Ready‑to‑use software over the internet; no local installs.
- Characteristics: Hosted/managed by provider, browser‑based, auto‑updates, subscription pricing.
- Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Dropbox, Zoom.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Definition: Managed environment to build, test, deploy apps without managing infrastructure.
- Characteristics: Frameworks, runtimes, tooling; provider manages OS/infra/security.
- Examples: Google App Engine, Azure App Services, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku.
- Clarification: SaaS = finished app for users; PaaS = platform for developers.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Definition: Virtualized compute, storage, networking; full control over OS and apps.
- Characteristics: On‑demand scalable resources; provider manages hardware.
- Examples: AWS EC2/S3, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine, IBM Cloud.
- Clarification: PaaS abstracts infra; IaaS exposes infra for maximum control.

## Comparison Table
| Feature | SaaS | PaaS | IaaS |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Control | Low | Medium | High |
| Infra Mgmt | Provider | Shared | User |
| Use Case | End‑users | Developers | IT/DevOps |
| Cost Model | Subscription | Pay‑as‑you‑go | Pay for resources |
| Advantages | Minimal setup; accessible; cost‑effective | Built‑in tools; less ops | Max control; scalable; flexible |
| Limitations | Limited customization; internet reliance; data trust | Less control; possible lock‑in; cost growth | Requires expertise; manage security/updates |

## Example Scenarios
- SaaS: Small business adopts Salesforce without managing installs.
- PaaS: Startup builds quickly on Google App Engine.
- IaaS: Enterprise runs configurable workloads on AWS EC2.

## Conclusion
Select SaaS/PaaS/IaaS based on needed control, customization, and operational overhead.
