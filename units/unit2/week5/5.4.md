# Advanced Logic Optimization and Applications

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Boolean algebra to simplify complex logic circuits.
- Use truth tables and K‑maps conceptually to derive minimal forms.
- Recognize real-world systems that rely on multi-gate logic.

---

## Recap: Core Boolean Laws
Refer to Week 5.3 for the full rules (Identity, Null, Idempotent, Inverse, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, De Morgan’s, Absorption).

---

## Example Optimizations
1) F = (A AND B) OR (A AND NOT B) OR (B AND C)
   - (A AND B) OR (A AND NOT B) = A → F = A OR (B AND C)

2) F = A AND (B OR C) + A AND (NOT B OR C)
   - = A AND ((B OR C) OR (NOT B OR C)) = A AND (C OR B OR NOT B)
   - = A AND (C OR 1) = A

K‑maps can further minimize where applicable by grouping 1s into powers of two.

---

## Multi-Gate Design Workflow
1) Specify inputs and the desired output conditions.
2) Build expression(s) and draw the logic diagram.
3) Verify behavior via a truth table.
4) Simplify using Boolean laws and/or K‑maps.

## Example System: Traffic Signal Controller
Green = (NOT Pedestrian) AND (Timer Expired OR Emergency)

Truth table headings: P, T, E, Green

---

## Example System: CPU ALU
A full adder uses AND, OR, and XOR to compute sums efficiently, illustrating layered gate design.

## Key Points
- Boolean simplification reduces gate count, cost, and power.
- De Morgan’s and Absorption are especially powerful in practice.
- Truth tables and K‑maps validate and minimize designs.
