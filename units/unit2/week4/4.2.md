# Week 4 Lesson 2 — Binary Encoding and Data Storage

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how binary stores data
- Understand fundamentals of binary encoding and its impact on storage/retrieval
- Describe how integers, text, images, audio, and video are stored in binary

## Why Binary?
Transistors switch ON/OFF; binary maps naturally: 1 = ON, 0 = OFF. Sequences of bits represent all data.

## Numbers in Binary
- Stored using base‑2 (powers of 2)
- More bits → larger range (e.g., 8‑bit: 0–255)

Example: 13₁₀ = 1101₂

## Text in Binary (Character Encoding)
- ASCII/Unicode map characters to numeric codes → binary
- Unicode supports global languages

## Images in Binary
- Pixels with binary codes for color/brightness
- Color images: RGB, commonly 24 bits per pixel (≈16M colors)
- Higher resolution → more data; compression reduces size

Examples:
- 1‑bit B/W image uses 0 for black, 1 for white
- 8‑bit layout illustration:

![](Pasted%20image%2020251101191618.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020251101191633.png)
## Audio in Binary
- Analog waves sampled (sample rate) and quantized (bit depth)
- CD quality: 44.1k samples/sec, 16‑bit samples
- Lossy (MP3) vs lossless formats impact size/quality

## Video in Binary
- Sequence of frames (images) + audio track
- FPS impacts smoothness; raw video is large → compression (MP4/H.264)
- Streaming adapts quality to bandwidth

## Storage Efficiency, Retrieval Speed, Security
- Efficiency: more bits = more space; compression (lossless/lossy) reduces size
- Retrieval: SSDs faster than HDDs; indexing/caching speeds lookups/streams
- Security: encryption (e.g., AES) protects data; parity/checksums detect errors

> **Answer:**
> 
> **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):**
> 
> - Developed in the 1960s, uses 7 bits (128 possible characters)
> - Extended ASCII uses 8 bits (256 characters)
> - Primarily supports English alphabet, digits, punctuation, and control characters
> - Limited to Latin script
> - Simple and efficient for English text
> 
> **Unicode:**

> - Supports emojis, mathematical symbols, and historical scripts
> 
> **Why Unicode Was Developed:**
> 
> As computing became global, ASCII's limitation to 128-256 characters became problematic. Different regions created incompatible character encodings (e.g., ISO-8859 series for European languages, Shift-JIS for Japanese). This caused data corruption and incompatibility when text moved between systems or languages. Unicode was created to provide a single, universal encoding that could represent all characters in all languages consistently.

> [!success]- Answer
> **Answer:**
> 
> **Parameter Definitions:**
> 
> **Sample Rate:**
> - Number of samples taken per second (measured in Hz/kHz)
> - Common values: 44.1 kHz (CD), 48 kHz (professional), 96 kHz (high-end)
> - Determines the highest frequency that can be accurately captured (Nyquist theorem: max frequency = sample rate ÷ 2)
> 
> **Bit Depth:**
> - Number of bits used to represent each sample's amplitude
> - Common values: 16-bit (CD), 24-bit (professional), 32-bit (high-end)
> - Determines dynamic range and quantization accuracy
> - Dynamic range ≈ 6 dB per bit (16-bit = 96 dB, 24-bit = 144 dB)
> 
> **File Size Relationship:**
> 
> File size (uncompressed) = Sample Rate × Bit Depth × Channels × Duration
> 
> Example: 48 kHz, 24-bit, stereo, 1 minute
> = 48,000 × 24 × 2 × 60 = 138,240,000 bits = 16.5 MB
> 
> **Effects on Audio Quality:**
> 
> **Sample Rate:**
> - Higher sample rates capture higher frequencies
> - Human hearing: ~20 Hz to 20 kHz
> - 44.1 kHz captures up to 22.05 kHz (above human hearing)
> - Higher rates (96 kHz, 192 kHz) provide headroom and reduce aliasing artifacts
> - Affects temporal resolution and transient capture
> 
> **Bit Depth:**
> - Higher bit depth = more amplitude levels = finer quantization
> - Reduces quantization noise and distortion
> - Increases dynamic range (difference between loudest and quietest sounds)
> - Lower bit depth can cause quantization errors, especially in quiet passages
> - 16-bit: 65,536 levels; 24-bit: 16,777,216 levels
> 
> **Trade-offs for Different Applications:**

> - **Storage**: Acceptable trade-off for quality (can compress later)
> - **Workflow**: Higher quality preserves options during editing
> 
> **2. Podcast/Voice Recording:**
> - **Recommendation**: 44.1 kHz / 16-bit or 48 kHz / 16-bit
> - **Reasoning**: Human voice has limited frequency range, 16-bit provides sufficient dynamic range
> - **Storage**: Smaller files important for distribution
> - **Quality**: Adequate for speech, unnecessary overhead for music
> 
> **3. Live Performance/Streaming:**
> - **Recommendation**: 44.1 kHz / 16-bit
> - **Reasoning**: Real-time constraints, bandwidth limitations
> - **Storage/Bandwidth**: Lower requirements essential for streaming
> - **Quality**: Acceptable for most listeners, reduces latency
> 
> **4. Audio Archival/Master Tapes:**
> - **Recommendation**: 96 kHz / 24-bit or higher
> - **Reasoning**: Future-proofing, maximum quality preservation
> - **Storage**: Less concern, archival priority
> - **Quality**: Capture everything possible for future use
> 
> **5. Mobile/Consumer Recording:**
> - **Recommendation**: 44.1 kHz / 16-bit
> - **Reasoning**: Storage/battery constraints, sufficient quality for casual use
> - **Storage**: Critical for mobile devices
> - **Quality**: Good enough for most consumer applications
> 
> **Key Trade-offs:**
> 
> 1. **Quality vs Storage**: Higher settings = better quality but larger files
> 2. **Quality vs Processing**: Higher settings require more CPU for real-time processing
> 3. **Quality vs Bandwidth**: Streaming higher quality requires faster internet
> 4. **Diminishing Returns**: Beyond certain thresholds (e.g., >96 kHz, >24-bit), quality improvements are minimal and often inaudible
> 5. **Target Audience**: Consumer vs professional requirements differ significantly
> 
> **Conclusion:**
> 
> The choice depends on application requirements, storage constraints, distribution method, and target quality standards. Professional recording benefits from higher settings (48-96 kHz / 24-bit) to preserve maximum information during production, while consumer applications can use lower settings (44.1 kHz / 16-bit) for acceptable quality with practical file sizes.

### Question 12: Scenario-Based - [11 marks] 🔴

**📊 Status:** 
- [ ] Completed 
- [ ] Correct 
- [ ] Challenging

A video game development company is designing a new mobile game that will include extensive use of graphics, sound effects, and background music. The game must be downloadable through app stores with size limitations and must run smoothly on various mobile devices.

**Game Assets:**
- 50 background images: 1920×1080, 24-bit color
- 200 character sprites: average 256×256, 32-bit color (with alpha channel)
- 30 sound effect files: average 2 seconds, need high quality
- 5 background music tracks: average 3 minutes each
- UI elements: 100 small images, average 128×128, 32-bit color

**Constraints:**
- Target download size: < 150 MB (app store limitation)
- Must maintain visual quality on high-end devices
- Must run efficiently on devices with limited RAM
- Audio quality should be good but not require excessive storage

(a) Calculate the total uncompressed size of all game assets. Show working for at least two asset types. [5 marks]

(b) Explain compression strategies you would recommend for each asset type (images, sound effects, music), justifying your choices. [4 marks]

(c) Discuss one additional technique beyond compression that could help manage storage and performance for this mobile game. [2 marks]

> [!success]- Answer
> **Answer:**
> 
> **(a) Uncompressed Asset Size Calculations:**
> 
> **Background Images:**
> - Pixels per image: 1920 × 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels
> - Bits per pixel: 24 bits
> - Bits per image: 2,073,600 × 24 = 49,766,400 bits
> - Bytes per image: 49,766,400 ÷ 8 = 6,220,800 bytes = 5.93 MB
> - Total for 50 images: 50 × 5.93 = 296.5 MB
> 
> **Character Sprites:**
> - Pixels per sprite: 256 × 256 = 65,536 pixels
> - Bits per pixel: 32 bits (24 color + 8 alpha)
> - Bits per sprite: 65,536 × 32 = 2,097,152 bits
> - Bytes per sprite: 2,097,152 ÷ 8 = 262,144 bytes = 0.25 MB
> - Total for 200 sprites: 200 × 0.25 = 50 MB
> 
> **Sound Effects:**
> - Assuming 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, mono (typical for sound effects)
> - Samples per file: 44,100 × 2 = 88,200 samples
> - Bits per file: 88,200 × 16 = 1,411,200 bits
> - Bytes per file: 1,411,200 ÷ 8 = 176,400 bytes = 0.17 MB
> - Total for 30 files: 30 × 0.17 = 5.1 MB
> 
> **Background Music:**
> - 48 kHz, 16-bit, stereo (typical for music)
> - Bits per second: 48,000 × 16 × 2 = 1,536,000 bits/sec
> - Bytes per second: 1,536,000 ÷ 8 = 192,000 bytes/sec = 0.183 MB/sec
> - Per 3-minute track: 0.183 × 180 = 32.94 MB
> - Total for 5 tracks: 5 × 32.94 = 164.7 MB
> 
> **UI Elements:**
> - Pixels per element: 128 × 128 = 16,384 pixels
> - Bits per element: 16,384 × 32 = 524,288 bits
> - Bytes per element: 524,288 ÷ 8 = 65,536 bytes = 0.0625 MB
> - Total for 100 elements: 100 × 0.0625 = 6.25 MB
> 
> **Total Uncompressed Size:**
> 296.5 + 50 + 5.1 + 164.7 + 6.25 = 522.55 MB
> 
> **(b) Compression Strategies:**
> 
> **Background Images:**
> - **Strategy**: Lossy JPEG compression with quality setting 85-90%
> - **Justification**: Large images (5.93 MB each), can tolerate some loss for significant size reduction. Quality 85-90% provides good visual quality with 80-85% size reduction. PNG would be lossless but much larger. JPEG appropriate for photographic-style backgrounds.
> - **Expected result**: 296.5 MB → ~45-60 MB (80-85% reduction)
> 
> **Character Sprites:**
> - **Strategy**: Lossless PNG compression (or indexed color PNG if colors < 256)
> - **Justification**: Sprites need sharp edges, transparency (alpha channel), and may be scaled/rotated. Lossy compression would create artifacts on edges. PNG handles transparency well and provides good compression for sprites with limited color palettes. If sprites use <256 colors, indexed PNG provides excellent compression.
> - **Expected result**: 50 MB → ~10-15 MB (70-80% reduction)
> 
> **Sound Effects:**
> - **Strategy**: Compressed audio format (OGG Vorbis or AAC) with quality setting 4-5 (out of 10)
> - **Justification**: Sound effects are short, need good quality for impact but don't require CD quality. OGG Vorbis or AAC provide excellent compression (10:1 to 15:1) with minimal quality loss. Lower quality settings acceptable as effects are brief.
> - **Expected result**: 5.1 MB → ~0.5-1 MB (80-90% reduction)
> 
> **Background Music:**
> - **Strategy**: Compressed audio (OGG Vorbis or AAC) with quality setting 6-7
> - **Justification**: Music is longer, requires better quality than sound effects. Quality 6-7 provides good balance (typical 8:1 to 12:1 compression) maintaining musical quality while significantly reducing size. Higher quality than sound effects justified by longer duration and aesthetic importance.
> - **Expected result**: 164.7 MB → ~15-20 MB (88-91% reduction)
> 
> **UI Elements:**
> - **Strategy**: Lossless PNG or WebP lossless
> - **Justification**: UI elements need sharp edges, transparency, and may be displayed at various sizes. Lossy compression would create visible artifacts on small, sharp UI elements. PNG provides good compression for UI graphics, or WebP lossless for even better compression while maintaining quality.
> - **Expected result**: 6.25 MB → ~1-2 MB (68-84% reduction)
> 
> **Total Compressed Size Estimate:**
> 45-60 + 10-15 + 0.5-1 + 15-20 + 1-2 = 71.5-98 MB (well under 150 MB limit)
> 
> **(c) Additional Technique:**
> 
> **Asset Streaming/On-Demand Loading:**
> 
> Instead of including all assets in the initial download, implement an asset streaming system:
> 
> - **Initial Download**: Include only essential assets needed to launch the game (main menu, first level basics)
> - **Progressive Download**: Download additional assets (backgrounds, music, later levels) as needed during gameplay
> - **Caching**: Store downloaded assets on device for future use
> - **Level-Based Loading**: Load assets only when entering specific levels or areas
> 
> **Benefits:**
> - Reduces initial download size significantly (could be <50 MB initial download)
> - Faster initial installation and startup
> - Better user experience (game playable sooner)
> - Allows higher quality assets to be downloaded when needed
> - Reduces RAM usage (only loaded assets consume memory)
> 
> **Implementation Considerations:**
> - Requires network connectivity for asset downloads
> - Need progress indicators for downloads
> - Must handle offline scenarios gracefully
> - Requires efficient asset management system
> 
> **Alternative Techniques:**
> - **Texture Atlasing**: Combine multiple small images (sprites, UI) into single texture sheets to reduce overhead
> - **Mipmaps**: Pre-generate smaller versions of images for different display resolutions
> - **Audio Streaming**: Stream music during gameplay rather than pre-loading all tracks
> 
> **Mark Scheme:**
> - **(a)** Correct calculations for at least two asset types with working [3 marks]
> - Correct total uncompressed size [2 marks]
> - **(b)** Appropriate compression strategy for images with justification [1 mark]
> - Appropriate compression strategy for audio with justification [1 mark]
