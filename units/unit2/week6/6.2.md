# Operating Systems: Integrity, Stability, and Core Functions

## Learning Objectives
- Explain OS integrity and background operation management.
- Describe memory, file, and device management for stability.
- Understand process scheduling, security, system accounting, GUI, virtualization, and networking.

---

## System Integrity
The OS enforces process isolation, memory protection, access control, and monitoring to keep the system secure and stable even with many concurrent processes.

Examples:
- Sandboxing on Android/iOS to limit app access.
- Memory protection prevents cross-process corruption.
- Windows Defender/macOS Gatekeeper protect against malware.

---

## Scheduling for Efficient Multitasking
Algorithms like Round Robin, Priority, and FCFS split CPU time to maintain responsiveness (e.g., audio playback prioritized while browsing).

---

## File System Integrity and Updates
- Journaling (ext4/NTFS) protects data across crashes.
- Automatic updates patch vulnerabilities and improve stability.

---

## Key OS Functions
1) Memory Management: paging/segmentation/virtual memory; efficient allocation/deallocation.
2) File System Management: naming, access, protection; NTFS/FAT32/ext4; cloud storage analogies.
3) Device Management: drivers, plug‑and‑play.
4) Process Scheduling: FCFS/RR/Priority/Multilevel queues.
5) System Security: encryption, access control, firewalls, real‑time scanning.
6) System Accounting: resource usage, logs, auditing.
7) GUI Management: windows, menus, drag‑and‑drop.
8) Virtualization: multiple OSs on one machine via VMs.
9) Networking: TCP/IP, DNS, firewalls, VPNs.

---

## Key Points
- Integrity = secure, stable, efficient environment.
- Isolation, protection, journaling, and updates safeguard data and performance.
- Scheduling keeps systems responsive; accounting/logging enables observability.
