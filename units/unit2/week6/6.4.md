# Polling vs. Interrupts: CPU Task Management and Performance

## Learning Objectives
- Explain polling and interrupt handling and their roles in CPU task management.
- Analyze event frequency, overhead, power, predictability, and latency trade‑offs.
- Compare approaches across keyboards, networks, disk I/O, embedded/real‑time systems.

---

## Concepts
### Polling
- CPU repeatedly checks device status in a loop.
- Simple but wastes CPU cycles when no event occurs.
- Useful for predictable, low‑priority tasks.

### Interrupts
- Devices signal CPU only when service is needed (IRQ).
- CPU saves state, runs ISR, then resumes work.
- Efficient and responsive; ideal for sporadic/time‑sensitive events.

---

## Performance Impacts
- Event frequency: polling is inefficient for rare events; interrupts excel.
- CPU overhead: polling increases load; interrupts reduce it.
- Power: polling drains battery; interrupts enable low‑power idle states.
- Predictability/latency: polling adds delay between checks; interrupts handle events immediately (beware interrupt storms).

## Real‑World Comparisons

| Scenario | Polling | Interrupts | Best Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keyboard/Mouse | Constant checks waste CPU | Event triggers immediate handling | Interrupts |
| Network I/O | Inefficient with irregular packets | NIC interrupts on arrival | Interrupts |
| Disk I/O | Busy‑wait for completion | Interrupt on completion | Interrupts |
| Embedded/IoT | Power cost too high | Wake on significant event | Interrupts |
| Real‑Time | Unreliable latency | Immediate reaction | Interrupts |

## Security and Power Notes
- Interrupt storm/flooding can degrade systems; use prioritization/filtering.
- Battery‑powered systems favor interrupts to extend life.

---

## Key Points
- Polling: simple but CPU/power heavy; predictable intervals.
- Interrupts: responsive and efficient; manage with prioritization to avoid overload.
