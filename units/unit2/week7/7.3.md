# Control Systems in the Real World

## Learning Objectives
- Explain control roles in automation and efficiency
- Identify components and functions
- Analyze applications and trade‑offs

---

## Autonomous Vehicles (Closed‑Loop)
- Components: GPS, LiDAR/radar/cameras, ECUs, actuators, V2X, safety systems
- Function: sensor fusion → AI decisions → actuators; route optimization; adaptive cruise
- Advantages: safety, reduced human error, fuel/traffic optimization

---

## Home Thermostats (Closed‑Loop)
- Components: temp/humidity sensors, MCU, HVAC interface, connectivity
- Function: compare to setpoint; schedules; ML for patterns; energy reports
- Advantages: energy savings, comfort, remote control

---

## Elevators (Closed‑Loop)
- Components: floor panel, weight/door sensors, motor controllers, safety brakes, diagnostics
- Function: optimize routing; AI traffic prediction; capacity/safety checks
- Advantages: safety, shorter waits, energy efficiency

---

## Washing Machines (Typically Open‑Loop; some Closed‑Loop)
- Components: water/load/temp sensors, drum motor, program selector
- Function: preset cycles; advanced units adjust water, cycle, spin via sensors/AI
- Advantages: efficient cleaning, water/energy savings, customization

---

## Traffic Signals (Open‑Loop or Closed‑Loop)
- Components: loops/cameras/buttons, timers, CPU, adaptive software, V2I
- Function: fixed cycles (open) vs sensor/AI‑adjusted timing (closed)
- Advantages: safety, reduced congestion/fuel

---

## Irrigation (Closed‑Loop)
- Components: soil moisture, weather data, valves/pumps, PLCs, AI scheduling
- Function: moisture‑driven watering; forecast‑aware; ET calculations
- Advantages: water conservation, yield, precision

---

## Home Security (Closed‑Loop)
- Components: motion/IR, cameras, access control, alarms, remote apps, AI anomaly detection
- Function: detect → alert/act; integrate locks/lights; emergency integration
- Advantages: real‑time monitoring, deterrence, rapid response

---

## Automatic Doors (Open‑Loop; some Closed‑Loop)
- Components: motion sensors, mats, actuators, safety overrides, control logic
- Function: trigger → open; safety obstacle detection; building integration
- Advantages: accessibility, convenience, energy savings
