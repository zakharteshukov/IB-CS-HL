        <h4>Introduction&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>Computational thinking is a problem-solving approach that mirrors the way computers process and resolve
            tasks. It involves a structured way of thinking that allows us to break down complex issues into simpler
            parts, identify patterns, eliminate unnecessary details, and design effective solutions. This mental
            framework isn't limited to writing code—instead, it equips learners with a set of universal strategies that
            can be applied to any challenge, whether it's optimizing a daily routine or designing a software program. It
            underpins much of modern computing but also has cross-disciplinary value in mathematics, science, and
            logical reasoning.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Today, we’ll briefly explore the four foundational concepts:&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="dp-content-block">
        <h4>1. Abstraction&nbsp;</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by focusing only on
            the essential information needed to solve a problem, while ignoring or removing irrelevant details. It
            allows us to manage complexity and concentrate on the core components that directly impact our task or
            goal.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Simple Example</strong>: Imagine using a city metro map. The map doesn’t show the actual geography of
            the city, such as terrain, traffic, or minor streets. It simply displays the stations, lines, and
            connections between them. This is all you need to navigate the train system, and everything else is
            abstracted away.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Computing Example</strong>: When designing a login screen for a website, the user only interacts with
            the username and password fields. The underlying processes—like how the password is encrypted, how the
            database query is structured, or how the screen layout is rendered—are abstracted from the user. From a
            programmer's point of view, abstraction might mean using a function to perform a task (e.g., validate login
            credentials) without needing to rewrite or understand every low-level detail of how that validation is
            performed.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Abstraction is a critical concept in computer science because it enables the creation of modular, reusable
            components and allows complex systems to be understood at a higher level.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="dp-content-block">

    </div>
    <div class="dp-content-block">
        <h4>2. Decomposition&nbsp;</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Decomposition is the process of breaking down a large, complex problem or system
            into smaller, more manageable parts. This allows each component to be tackled individually, making it easier
            to understand, solve, and debug. Decomposition also promotes teamwork, as different parts of a larger system
            can be developed in parallel.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Simple Example</strong>: Planning a party may seem like a big task, but it becomes easier when
            divided into subtasks: selecting a venue, creating an invitation list, arranging catering, planning
            entertainment, setting up decorations, and managing RSVPs. Each of these smaller tasks can be approached and
            completed independently.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Computing Example</strong>: When developing a video game, the project is typically split into various
            systems—graphics for rendering images, input handling for controls, audio for sound effects and music, logic
            for scoring and game rules, and networking for multiplayer functionality. Each system can be assigned to
            different team members or development phases, and debugging or updating one system becomes far easier than
            trying to alter the whole game at once.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Decomposition is fundamental in both human and computer-based problem-solving because it transforms
            overwhelming challenges into sequences of smaller steps that are more approachable and solvable.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="dp-content-block">
        <h4>3. Pattern Recognition&nbsp;</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Pattern recognition is the ability to identify similarities, trends, or repeated
            elements in data or processes. Recognizing patterns helps problem-solvers anticipate outcomes and apply
            existing solutions to new but similar problems, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing redundant
            effort.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Simple Example</strong>: Consider your daily commute. If you observe that traffic consistently builds
            up near certain intersections at specific times, you begin to recognize a pattern. This knowledge helps you
            adjust your route or departure time in future trips to avoid delays.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Computing Example</strong>: In spam email detection, pattern recognition plays a crucial role.
            Algorithms analyze vast numbers of emails and look for recurring keywords, sentence structures, or sender
            behavior that typically appear in spam. By identifying these patterns, the system can classify new incoming
            messages as spam or not, without needing to manually assess each one.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Pattern recognition is particularly useful in areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, and
            machine learning, where identifying and using patterns helps to make predictions, streamline processes, and
            adapt to new situations based on past observations.&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="dp-content-block">
        <h4>4. Algorithmic Design&nbsp;</h4>
        <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Algorithmic design refers to the creation of a clearly defined, step-by-step
            procedure or set of instructions that solves a specific problem or performs a particular task. These
            instructions should be logical, unambiguous, efficient, and repeatable, ensuring consistent outcomes
            whenever followed. In computer science, an algorithm must also consider time and space efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Simple Example</strong>: A cooking recipe is a classic example of an algorithm. It provides a clear
            list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions to produce a dish. If someone follows the same
            instructions in the same order, they should end up with a similar result. Missing or rearranging steps—such
            as baking before adding flour—would lead to failure, just like a poorly designed algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Computing Example</strong>: Imagine you're tasked with writing a program to calculate the average
            grade for a group of students. An effective algorithm might include the following steps: initialize a total
            score to 0, iterate through each student’s score and add it to the total, count the number of students, and
            finally divide the total by the number of students to get the average. This algorithm is deterministic and
            structured, allowing a computer to follow it easily without ambiguity.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Algorithmic thinking helps translate human logic into machine-executable instructions and is crucial for
            creating functional, reliable, and scalable software solutions.&nbsp;</p>
