# Week 3 Lesson 1 — CPU Pipelining and Multi‑Core Execution

## Learning Objectives
- Explain pipelining and its stages (fetch, decode, execute, write‑back).
- Describe how pipelining improves performance in multi‑core architectures.
- Understand how multiple cores function independently and in parallel.

## Introduction to Pipelining
Pipelining improves throughput by processing different stages of multiple instructions concurrently, like an assembly line.

## Stages of Pipelining
| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| Fetch | Processor retrieves the next instruction from memory. |
| Decode | Instruction is interpreted to determine required operations. |
| Execute | ALU/units perform computations. |
| Write‑back | Results are written to registers or memory. |

## Pipelining in Multi‑Core Architectures
- Instruction‑level parallelism (ILP): Multiple instructions in flight.
- Superscalar: Multiple instructions per cycle.
- Out‑of‑order execution: Execute as resources become available.

## How Cores Work Independently and in Parallel
- Independent execution: OS schedules separate tasks to different cores to reduce bottlenecks.
- Parallel execution: Split large tasks into sub‑tasks processed simultaneously (e.g., video rendering across frames).
- Additional features:
  - Task scheduling across cores
  - Cache sharing in some designs
  - Energy efficiency via load distribution

## Benefits and Challenges of Pipelining
| Benefits | Challenges |
|---|---|
| Faster execution via overlapping stages | Pipeline hazards and dependency handling |
| Better CPU resource utilization | Complexity to manage dependencies |
| Reduced instruction cycle time | Increased power/heat |

## Summary and Self‑Check
- Pipelining divides instruction execution into stages to improve efficiency.
- Multi‑core: independent pipelines per core; higher throughput.
- ILP, superscalar, out‑of‑order further optimize performance.
