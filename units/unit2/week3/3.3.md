# Week 3 Lesson 3 — Data Compression: Lossless vs Lossy

## Learning Objectives
- Explain data compression and its importance.
- Differentiate lossy vs lossless compression.
- Describe RLE and transform coding.

## Introduction to Compression
Compression reduces data size to save storage and improve transmission.

- Reduces storage requirements
- Speeds up network transmission
- Improves efficiency and lowers bandwidth usage

## Types of Compression
|  | Lossless Compression | Lossy Compression |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | Reduces file size without losing information | Removes some data; slight quality loss |
| Mechanism | Original data reconstructed exactly | Discards redundant/less important data |
| Examples | ZIP, PNG, FLAC | JPEG, MP3, MP4 |
| Use Cases | Text, code, medical imaging | Multimedia and web images |

## Compression Techniques
|  | Run‑Length Encoding (RLE) | Transform Coding |
|---|---|---|
| Concept | Encode repeated runs as value + count | Convert data to a transform domain and quantize |
| Example | AAAAABBBBCCCCCCDD → A5B4C6D2 | JPEG uses DCT to remove high‑frequency components |
| Applications | Simple images (BMP/TIFF), fax | JPEG images, MP3 audio, MPEG video |

## Key Points
- Compression saves space and improves efficiency.
- Lossless preserves exact data; lossy trades quality for higher ratios.
- RLE is simple lossless; transform coding is common lossy for media.

## Reflection and Practice
- Why is compression important today?
- When is lossless preferable? When is lossy acceptable?
- RLE exercise: compress “AAABBBCCCCDDDDEE” and compute ratio.
- Experiment: compare an uncompressed image vs a compressed JPEG; note quality differences vs size.
